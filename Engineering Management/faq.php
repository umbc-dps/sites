<div class="accordionheader">
  <h4><a name="1"></a>What  are the academic requirements for admission to the Engineering Management Certificate  Program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>

<div class="accordionbody">
<p>Applicants must have a B.S. degree, preferably in Engineering,  Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry or other physical science. Professional work experience is desirable, but  not required. The minimum GPA for normal acceptance to UMBC graduate programs  is 3.0. However, applicants with a lower  GPA may be admitted to the certificate program with the provision that they  must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher in order to continue in the program and to  receive a certificate.&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><a name="9" id="9"></a>Is the UMBC Engineering Management program  accredited?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>

<div class="accordionbody">
<p>In general, undergraduate engineering programs are accredited by ABET and graduate programs are not. The University System of Maryland requires that all university academic programs be reviewed every seven years. The UMBC Engineering Management program was reviewed by an external review team in 2009 and received excellent marks. UMBC is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education; the Accrediting Board for Engineering Technology, Inc.; and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education.    The 2006 <a href="http://www.msche.org/" target="_blank">Middle States Evaluation Team</a> found UMBC to be in full compliance with all standards of excellence.</p>

<div class="accordionheader">
  <h4><a name="10" id="10"></a> Is it possible to get a double master&rsquo;s  in Engineering Management and Systems Engineering by counting some of the  courses toward both degrees?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>

<div class="accordionbody">
<p>UMBC does not allow graduate courses to be counted toward  more than one graduate degree.&nbsp; In order  to receive both the M.S. in Engineering Management and the M.S. in Systems  Engineering, it is necessary to take a total of 20 graduate courses.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordionheader">
  <h4><a name="11" id="11"></a>What is the deadline for applying to the  program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>

<div class="accordionbody">The application deadline is generally four weeks before the beginning of the semester for domestic students. However, it is advisable to apply much sooner than this to ensure that your application materials will be received in time for admission.&nbsp; Often, transcripts are delayed in transmission from your undergraduate university.</p>
   <p>International applicants must apply much sooner, generally six months before the beginning of the semester, to ensure that they will have enough time to receive a U.S. visa.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordionheader">
  <h4><a name="11" id="11"></a> Can I take courses at other universities and apply them to the M.S. in Engineering Management?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>

<div class="accordionbody"><p>Students can take <em><strong>up to two courses</strong></em> from other universities by following the inter-institutional enrollment process.</p>
   <p>Inter-institutional enrollment is a program that allows qualifying students at University System of Maryland (USM) institutions to take selected courses at other USM campuses while only paying tuition at their home school. Through the program, students register for courses at both their home and host institutions, but are billed only by their home school. At the end of the semester, the student's credits and grades from the host institution are transferred to their home institution. This differs from standard transfer coursework in that both credits and grades transfer. The deadline for registering for courses at another institution is two weeks before the start of the semester. </p>
