 <h3>Student Messages to Future Project Management Students: </h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to learn about Project Management you  must take Anita's class. She fully understands what she is talking about, the class  is extremely organized and you will never be bored. Follow all the steps of the  weekly guide and you will successful on her class but be prepare to work hard. </li>
  <li>This class allows you to understand what Project  Management is.  Before taking this class I  had no idea the steps needed to effectively execute a project.  By taking this class I was able to gain perspective  on creating a WBS, schedule, risk roster, and change management.  I strongly recommend this class if you are thinking  of a career in project management. </li>
  <li>The course is amazing, and so is the instructor.  She is the best you could ask for. </li>
  <li>If I were to tell future students about this class  I would say communication is the key. When you are a PM communication is important  and you will learn this working in your groups and with other teams. Also throughout  the semester make sure that you and your team go over the contract to make sure  that everyone is still in compliance. If things changes in your group make sure  that you write it in the contract so that your team will be on the same page this  can eliminate confusion and tension among your group.  </li>
  <li>Make sure you read and understand the topics before  class.  This way you can contribute and also  understand what questions you need to ask.    If you don't get enough information or data, it takes several iterations  and class participation over email is difficult to get.  </li>
  <li>Be ready to work and to work on something that you  might think is mundane.  In the end you will  see that what seemed mundane before is an important task in the grand scheme of  the project and you will be fulfilled to see it come together.  </li>
  <li>Anita is the best!  Participate in class exercises; it helps you understand  the concept better.  </li>
  <li>ENGM 650 is good fundamentals course on Project Management.  It will get you on the right track for a PM role. You will cover a wide range of  topics and get some hands on experience. You will also be able to practice and develop  your team and presentation skills. </li>
  <li>This is an involved class. It requires exceptional  team dynamics and patience. Keep your head down and work hard. This class will be  one of your most rewarding classes with practical applications. Are you strong and  dedicated enough to put team members and goals before your own? If so, come on and  let&rsquo;s start learning basics of PMP. </li>
  <li>Dear Future Student,    Good idea taking this class, while you're going  through the class, try to do as good a job as you can on the deliverables as you  work your way through the class. Also, make sure you clear your schedule for the  panel discussion, it's really good. Make sure that you learn how to use MS Project;  you'll use it every day. </li>
  <li>The class has a lot of information and goes by quickly.  It&rsquo;s a fun class that you can learn a lot by a  lot of interaction with people from all industries and positions in the work force. </li>
  <li>I will first and most importantly encourage them  to start studying from the beginning of the class and not overlook the class. It's  so much but interesting topics to cover; and be prepared to learn.  Class subjects may look easy to understand but  require more invested hours. It is an exciting class. </li>
  <li>Like life, what you put into the class, you'll get  out tenfold, when it is done.  The skills,  through the group work and discussions are invaluable, especially for a more self  paced motivator.  Being able to work, function,  and learn with a group, as efficiently as the process requires, is an invaluable  tool that you will be able to take with you, in real life.  </li>
  <li>Be ready to work hard, putting in the time, while  at the same time you are having fun at it. </li>
  <li>It's wonderful course that every project management  practitioner must take to understand processes and best practices. </li>


  <li>Enjoy the class; make the most of group interactions.  Learn to utilize and trust your team.  This class is not all about learning facts, but  involves a lot of application and development of communication skills. </li>
  <li>This course is surely recommended. And Anita does  a great job. Want to learn Project management concepts and have a real time project  experience....EM650 is the course !!!... </li>
  <li>Take this class! </li>
  <li>It is one of the most interactive classes I have  ever been. An up to date course material, coupled with an exciting lecturer who  made judicious use of the time. Students are completely engaged in the use and application  of project management tools in real life projects. </li>
  <li>This course requires a moderate amount of focus and  consideration. You must be prepared to give professional presentations, as well  as work in a team efficiently to provide assigned deliverables for submission. It  is suggested that you devise a system for keeping track of various requirements  throughout the course. </li>
  <li>Project Management is a great course to take.  The instructor Anita does not just have you memorize  a textbook, she allows you to live out life as a project manager during her class.  In addition to learning about the concepts of  project management and processes of executing a project you will learn about how  project managers fit in within an organization.   With your team and class projects you will leave the class having full hands  on experience working as a project manager. </li>
  <li>You will enjoy the class and hopefully you will have  a good team.  Don't hold back any complaints  about other teams. </li>
