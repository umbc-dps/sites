            Corporations  are applying radically new management techniques to remain competitive. Today,  information forms the basis for competitive advantage as companies are competing  as much on their ability to create and manage new information, as they do on marketing  and selling their physical products and associated services. This course  studies how organizations create and use knowledge to support their operations  and strategic planning. A &ldquo;knowledge-creating&rdquo; company is said to be one that  consistently creates new knowledge, disseminates it widely throughout the  organization, and quickly embodies it in new technologies and products, and  whose sole business is continuous innovation. Actions are investigated which  corporate executives and managers can take to improve their management,  translation, and utilization of knowledge, to increase their organization&rsquo;s absorptive  capacities and ability to learn quickly, to posture themselves for innovative  responses to changing market conditions, to handle disruptive technology  cycles, to implement the effective use of data analytics, and to develop  sustainable business models and improve organizational performance.</p>
            
 <p>Businesses  collected more customer information in 2010, than in all prior years combined.  The amount of corporate data being collected is said to be doubling every 6  months. The intellectual property of these companies will take a second seat and  their ability to compete will depend on their current absorptive capacity, and  their capacity to learn as an organization faster than their competitors.  This course prepares students for future  market environments where innovative businesses will compete based on their  ability to process information and learn, and learn quickly. This course has  selected the most relevant research papers in the fields of knowledge  management, organizational learning, and strategic planning. After this course,  you will be familiar with the most significant research dedicated to optimizing  business and project processes that has been released in the last decade. Each  research paper has been summarized in 2 to 3 page reports to help students  manage the significant amounts of information and to track the key points being  made in each paper. The future may already be here, so why not be prepared for  it!</p>

 <p>A wide range of applications such as disaster management, military and security have fueled the interest in sensor networks during the past few years. Sensors are typically capable of wireless communication and are significantly constrained in the amount of available resources such as energy, storage and computation. Such constraints make the design and operation of sensor networks considerably different from contemporary wireless networks, and necessitate the development of resource conscious protocols and management techniques. This course provides a broad coverage of challenges and latest research results related to the design and management of wireless sensor networks. Covered topics include network architectures, node discovery and localization, deployment strategies, node coverage, routing protocols, medium access arbitration, fault-tolerance, and network security.</p>

 <p>This course covers the translation of design specifications into product elements, integration of these elments into a system, and the verification that the resulting system performs as intended in it operational environment. <strong>Prerequisites: </strong>ENEE 660 and ENEE 661 or consent of instructor.</p>
 <p>** A student who completes the above four Systems Engineering courses plus ENEE 670 - Systems Engineering Project will earn the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Systems Engineering, as described at <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/se/certificate">Systems Engineering - Post-Baccalaureate Certificate</a>.</p>

 <p>This course is either an individual or group project on an approved topic in the Systems Engineering (SE) Certificate, the SE track within the Master&rsquo;s in Electrical Engineering or the SE track within the Masters in Computer Science, non-thesis option. The project serves as an integrating mechanism to allow the student to demonstrate a working level understanding by applying the knowledge gained in the coursework leading up to this capstone course. The "project" requires a sequence of tasks required to achieve an end result that requires the use of multiple EE domains, disciplines and tools. Underlying the need for the result of the project are the essential lessons learned from case studies of major programs. The project will be tailored to allow completion and submission as partial satisfaction for a Certificate in Systems Engineering.</p>

 <p>This course emphasizes the many partitioning alternatives that  can be employed when developing physical systems architectures, including  hierarchical partitioning, federated partitioning, scalable architectures, high  availability architectures, and collaborative systems. &nbsp;The course also  deals with methods for architecting successful systems, such as achieving data  integrity, managing system workflow, and constructing representation models.</p>
 <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> It is assumed that the student  is familiar with the systems engineering process and the various development  methodologies. ENEE 660: Systems Engineering Principles and ENEE 661: Systems  Architecture and Design</p>

 <p>This course provides an overview of decision and risk analysis techniques.  It focuses on how to make rational decisions in the presence of uncertainty and  conflicting objectives. It covers modeling uncertainty, the principles of  rational decision-making, representing and solving decision problems using  influence diagrams and decision trees, sensitivity analysis, Bayesian decision  analysis, deductive and inductive reasoning, objective and subjective  probabilities, probability distributions, regression analysis, defining and  calculating the value of information, modeling risk attitudes and utility  functions. Concepts will be illustrated through case studies and practiced by  students through homework. </p>
