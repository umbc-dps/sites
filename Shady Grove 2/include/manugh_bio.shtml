      <p><strong>One interesting fact about myself:<br />
      </strong>I am  trilingual as I speak Armenian, Russian and English - blame it on my passion  for exploring new cultures! </p>
      <p><strong>Why did you choose  UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br />        
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove for many  reasons. The smaller classes provide an intimate atmosphere and help me  interact freely with professors and other students. The accessible parking lot  and location allows for an easy, convenient commute. In addition, the vast  variety of foods and drinks offered at the Green Grove Cafe during lunch hours  curb my food cravings during long study hours. Another great resource is the  Priddy Library which has extended hours during weekdays, allowing me to focus  on studying without having to worry about the closing hours. </p></td>
