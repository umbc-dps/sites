<p>Craig Behm is a Director at Audacious Inquiry, a health  information technology and policy firm in Baltimore, Maryland. He primarily  serves as the Director of Hospital Services for the Chesapeake Regional  Information System for our Patients (CRISP), the state-designated health  information exchange. In that role, Mr. Behm works directly with hospitals and  their community partners to execute population health activities leveraging  technology and data. Previously, he was the program director for the reporting  and analytics services provided by CRISP. Mr. Behm is also an instructor at the  University of Maryland Baltimore County Master&rsquo;s program in Health Information  Technology, where he teaches students how to design, measure, prioritize, and  implement improvement efforts across complicated health care systems.</p>

  <p>Prior to joining Audacious Inquiry, Mr. Behm was the  Executive Director of MedChi Network Services (MNS), a firm that offers  practice services and Accountable Care Organization (ACO) management as a  subsidiary of MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society. He created the  initial formation strategy for MNS and executed on those plans to form two  distinct service lines advancing health care delivery. MNS was a  state-designated management services organization and a co-recipient of federal  funding through the Maryland Regional Extension Center, operated by CRISP.  Through that partnership, MNS developed secure methods for the effective  utilization of electronic health records. MNS assisted hundreds of small  practices to reach Meaningful Use of certified EHRs, and continues to help with  implementation and optimization of IT systems.</p>
  <p>While at MNS, Mr. Behm was also the Executive Director of  the three ACOs affiliated with MedChi. He performed a vital role in the ACO  formation process and led clinical integration and quality improvement actions.  All three ACOs were selected for the competitive Advance Payment program (out  of 33 total nationwide). Through those groups, MNS coordinated health care  needs for over 25,000 Medicare beneficiaries through a network of nearly 100  independent primary care providers. Mr. Behm facilitated the expansion of ACOs  and related services to enhance the private practice of medicine.</p>
