<p><em><strong>Before the  semester</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Speak with your academic advisor and discuss a class schedule that is manageable.</li>
  <li>Think about repeating key courses in which you have performed poorly for a second attempt or <a href="http://academicpolicy.umbc.edu/home/undergraduate-petitions/" target="_blank">petitioning</a> the Office of Undergraduate Education for a third and final attempt when warranted.</li>

<p>Learning is a matter of committing both time and energy to your studies.  What does this mean? For every hour in class, you should be spending two to  three hours studying.

          </div>

          <div class="accordionbody">
<p>Depending on where you are in the semester, you may ask yourself whether  the decision to withdraw or drop a class is reasonable. However, withdrawing or  dropping from courses may:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lead to loss of financial aid or health  insurance </li>
  <li>have an impact on immigration status</li>
  <li>increase the  time it takes to graduate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dropping a class</strong>â removing a course from your schedule during the  Schedule Adjustment Period at the beginning of the semester. You may receive a  pro-rated refund based on the date the course is dropped. <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/academic-calendar/pdf-calendars/">Deadlines to drop courses apply</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawing from a class</strong> - removing a course from your schedule after  the Schedule Adjustment Period. Your transcript will reflect a grade of  &quot;W&quot; for the course. Even though you did not complete the course, a  withdrawal will be considered a course attempt. <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/academic-calendar/pdf-calendars/" target="_blank">Deadlines to withdraw from courses apply</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Before making the decision to drop/withdraw from a class:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Talk to your instructor/s in the course(s). Ask for strategies that will help you understand and study the subject.</li>
  <li>Find out if the department has additional academic support services, such as discussion groups or test files.</li>
  <li>Speak with your academic advisor and discuss whether reducing your overall credit load will allow more time to focus on each course.</li>
  <li>Consider using different <a href="http://lrc.umbc.edu/alerts/study-well/" target="_blank">study techniques</a>.</li>
  <li>Study with a <a href="http://www.shadygrove.umd.edu/student-services/center-for-academic-success/peersupport" target="_blank">tutor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Reach out to <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/financialaid/" target="_blank">Financial Aid</a> to see how your reward may be adjusted if  you withdraw/drop from a class. For more info, please call 410-455-2387.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Visit the <a href="http://www.shadygrove.umd.edu/student-services/center-for-academic-success" target="_blank">Center for Academic Success</a> for writing assistance, guided study sessions, workshops on time management, academic coaching, tutoring, and/or disability support.

  <li>International students should reach out to <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/ies/services/current.html" target="_blank">International Education Services</a> to see if withdrawing/dropping a course will affect their immigration status. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you make the decision to drop/withdraw  from a course, then there are two  steps that must be completed:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>First, you must contact your academic advisor.</li>
  <li>Second, you must officially drop/withdraw from the course using myUMBC by the <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/academic-calendar/pdf-calendars/" target="_blank">semester&rsquo;s deadline</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please take notice:</strong> Students  may not register for a course more than two times. Students are considered  registered for a course if they are enrolled after the end of the schedule  adjustment period. Students may petition the <a href="http://academicpolicy.umbc.edu/home/undergraduate-petitions/" target="_blank">Office of Undergraduate Education (OUE)</a> for a third  and final attempt of a course taken at UMBC or another  institution. An attempt is defined as enrollment in a course, or its equivalent  at another institution, in which the student has received a grade or an  official withdraw was given. This includes credit by exam or if a student  withdraws from the entire semester/session. Students should consult with their  academic departments for additional restrictions or policies regarding repeated  courses.</p>
