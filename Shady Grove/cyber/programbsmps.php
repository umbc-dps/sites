 <h3>Accelerated BS/MPS Program Option</h3>
 <p><em>Note: For Academic Year 2015/16 this program is only offered to CMSC students.</em></p>
 <p>UMBC Computer Science majors also considering a Master of Professional Studies (MPS) degree in Cybersecurity may apply for admission to an accelerated course of study leading to the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Master of Professional Studies in Cybersecurity degrees. This program is open to full-time and part-time students.</p>
 <p>The Cybersecurity BS/MPS program has two phases. In Phase I, undergraduate students may take up to nine (9) credits of graduate level course work, subject to the restrictions listed below, which may be applied towards the requirements of both degrees. Students typically apply for Phase I of the program after completing CMSC 313, 331, and 341. Phase II corresponds to admission into the MPS program.</p>
 <p>Admission to Phase I is based on the student's academic record, an evaluation of the student's Statement of Purpose, and an interview. Students may apply for admission into the BS/MPS program at any time after completing CMSC 201, CMSC 202, CMSC 203, CMSC 313, CMSC 331, CMSC 341, MATH 151, MATH 152, and MATH 221.</p>
 <p>Applicants to Phase I are expected to have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher and an average of 3.5 or higher in their computer science courses.</p>
 <p>Once admitted to Phase I, the student may take up to nine (9) credits of graduate level Computer Science and Cybersecurity courses (excluding CMSC 698 699, CYBR 624) that can be applied towards the requirements for both the Bachelors and MPS degrees provided they receive a B or higher grade. The student selects these three (3) graduate courses in consultation with his or her faculty advisor, such as:</p>
 
<h4>Courses for Cybersecurity BS/MPS Program</h4>
<p>Acceptable courses for the BS/MPS program include but are not limited to:</p>
 <UL>
   <li>CMSC 626 (Principles of Computer Security)</li>
   <li>CMSC 643 (Cryptography and Data Security)</li>
   <li>CMSC 644 (Information Assurance)</li>
   <li>CMSC 652 (Cryptology)</li>
   <li>CMSC 687 (Network Security)</li>
   <li>CMSC 691 (Malware Analysis)</li>
   <li>CYBR 621 (Cyber Warfare)</li>
   <li>CYBR 623 (Cybersecurity Law and Policy)</li>
   <li>CYBR 644 (Cyber Practitioner Development Lab)</li>
   <li>CYBR 658 (Risk Analysis Compliance)</li>
   <li>CYBR 691 (Special Topics in Cybersecurity) <br>
     (Note: excludes CYBR 620 in most cases – BS/MPS students should take CMSC 626 or 687.)</li> 
 </UL>
 
 <p>Questions about what constitutes appropriate courses approved for transfer into the CYBR MPS should be directed to the Cybersecurity Graduate Program Director, Dr. Rick Forno (<a href="mailto:richard.forno@umbc.edu">richard.forno@umbc.edu</a>).</p>

 <h4>Important Notes</h4> 
<p>Admission to Phase II is based on the same criteria as admission into the regular MPS degree program: academic record, goal statement, resume, and (optional) letters of recommendation. Contact Rickeysha Jones (<a href="mailto:rcjones@umbc.edu">rcjones@umbc.edu</a>) or visit umbc.edu/shadygrove/cyber for CYBR MPS application information or admissions questions.</p>
<p>
  In accordance with Graduate School policy, applicants to Phase II (the MPS degree) must have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher, and maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher during the course of their graduate studies. (Note: Admission into Phase I does not constitute a promise to admit the student to Phase II.) </p>
  
  <p>
  Students are responsible for meeting any course prerequisites indicated.</p>

<p>
<strong>The B.S. Computer Science program is only available at the Main Campus in Baltimore, MD. However, CMSC majors may take the masters level coursework at the Shady Grove campus in Rockville, MD.</strong>
