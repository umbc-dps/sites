    <strong>An interesting personal fact...</strong><br>
    One interesting fact about me is that I love to smile..
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    After graduating from the Mental Health program at Montgomery College, I had an urge to major in social work. I decided to speak with alumni of UMBC-Shady Grove. Each one of them was quick to praise and speak positively of the University because of their experiences as past students. With research, I discovered that UMBC-Shady Grove offers the best social work undergraduate program in the entire Washington Metropolitan area. More so, I also found out that UMBC–Shady Grove is a multicultural institution which implies that diversity is highly valued. As a future social worker, a multicultural environment is exactly what I need to learn more about other cultures in order to become effective in my practice. These findings propelled me to become a part of the UMBC-Shady Grove community.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>In what internships or extracurricular activities have you been involved at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Though there are several extracurricular activities at UMBC-Shady Grove. I decided to join the Social Work Student Association (SWSA), and Tau Sigma National Transfer Honor Society. These associations help to connect students to educational and social opportunities. They also enable students to participate in community outreach activities. Students can sometimes earn extra-credit when participating in some of these activities. Moreover, I am a UMBC Peer Advisory Team member (PAT) at UMBC-Shady Grove. The PAT has given me the opportunity to learn leadership skills and to help prospective students with their process of transition into UMBC-Shady Grove. The PAT provide continuous support and guidance to new students throughout their first semester at UMBC-Shady Grove to enhance their success. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After graduating, I intend to proceed with my studies at a graduate school to earn a Master‘s in Social Work. I would like to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW-C) in order to work with adolescents who have addiction issues. I also hope to work with senior citizens, though there is a possibility that my aspirations could change over time as I proceed with my education. I am very excited and open minded about the direction of my future with UMBC-Shady Grove’s social work program. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What advice would you provide to a prospective student?</strong><br>
    Transitioning into a new environment can be very stressful for new students. It’s very easy to become confused and concerned about unforeseen factors. My advice to prospective students is that you should visit UMBC-Shady Grove in order to become more knowledgeable about your educational options and career. Moreover, you should make sure that your Common Application and documentation needed for scholarships is submitted in a timely period in order to receive the full financial benefits that are available to students. Lastly, once enrolled in classes at UMBC-Shady Grove, try to stay informed by becoming a part of the many associations and groups on campus. Also, checking your email regularly will help you avoid any chance of missing important deadlines or information that will facilitate your learning process.

    One interesting fact about me is that I love to sing in the shower and listen to 80’s music such as” I Just Called to Say I Love You” by Stevie Wonder and "We're Not Gonna Take It “by Twisted Sister.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC- Shady Grove because it is an Honor’s University . Being a student at UMBC-Shady Grove means I have some of the best professors in the country as my instructors. In addition, the UMBC- Shady Grove campus is very convenient for commuting purposes.  It is an institution that motivates and rewards students with all the resources and attention they need to succeed.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans after graduation? </strong><br>
    I plan to obtain a steady job with benefits after graduation and then pursue a Master’s  in Divinity. I have many goals for the future and one of them is to become a counselor.  I hope to help those in need, be a light to others, and have fun.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What advice would you provide to a prospective student?</strong><br>
    After celebrating the positive result of your admission into UMBC-Shady Grove, you may be wondering what is next.  My advice to all prospective students is to develop an idea of what classes you will need to take and do not pile too much on your plate during your first semester.  Take it easy and get acquainted with your program of study.  After your first semester you will be able to better figure out the number of credits you can take without getting overwhelmed.  Explore the campus, attend as many events as possible, be open to many groups and organizations, make lots of friends, and most importantly take your studies seriously.

</p>

<p>

    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove because of the location and the small class sizes. With its location in Rockville, Maryland, UMBC-Shady Grove allows me to have a manageable commute and stay close to home. Additionally, the small class sizes that you get at UMBC-Shady Grove are great in that they give you the opportunity to make relationships with students and professors.

</p>

<p>

    An interesting fact about me is that I write poetry and play basketball.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove because it is an Honors University and it enables me access to a high quality education that's just 20 minutes away from my home and my multiple jobs. Also, the class sizes at UMBC-Shady Grove are small and I appreciate the state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. It's a safe and very dynamic environment.  
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What do you like best about UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    What I like about UMBC-Shady Grove is the location and the environment. There are so many resources that are available to students. The faculty has an open door policy which means they are always there if you need them, enabling you to build a strong relationship. The class sizes are small so you don't just feel like just a number, but that you matter. Lastly, UMBC-Shady Grove is like my second home. I arrive on campus in the morning to work out, go to class and then at night I spend time in the library for late night study hours.     
</p> 

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Currently, I am involved with the UMBC Peer Advisory Team (PAT). PAT members assist with recruitment events, provide tours of the Universities at Shady Grove campus and connect with prospective students interested in attending UMBC-Shady Grove. I am also part of The Universities at Shady Grove Student Event Board (SEB). SEB sponsors a variety of student events and activities. In the future, I hope to join the Psychology Student Association (PSA). 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    I am a psychology major and hope to become a school counselor. I want to work with high school students. When I was in high school I had an amazing counselor who helped guide me through my high school experience as a student athlete. My main interest is to help students with special needs and to guide students through their high school experience in preparation for college. Lastly, I want to create a program through which kids with special needs are able to participate in physical activities and complete homework with peers who do not have special needs. I believe that everyone deserves a chance.  I believe it’s important that we as individuals “don't judge a book by its cover” because we often don't know or understand the life experience of others until we walk a day in their shoes. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
     I would advise prospective students to take risks, use resources, and never be afraid to show people your true colors or who you are. It takes time to settle in, so don't rush. Get involved with school organizations. There are many useful resources here at UMBC-Shady Grove. Don't be afraid to ask for help. College is about finding who you are and what you want to pursue as a career.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    An interesting fact about myself is that I was born and raised in the United Kingdom (unfortunately, no, I do not still have a British accent). I moved to the United States in 2007, and just this past December I became a U.S. Citizen!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove for a few reasons. First off, after going to Montgomery College I realized that I really enjoyed a small classroom setting versus big lecture halls. UMBC-Shady Grove offers a UMBC education, but with the small classroom size that you can find at smaller universities and community colleges. I also wanted to be able to work and attend school at the same time.  Since UMBC-Shady Grove is convenient, it makes it easier for me to also work at the same time. Finally, I chose UMBC-Shady Grove because I really liked the diversity of the psychology program and how broad the areas of study are.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Since starting here in Fall 2015, I have joined Tau Sigma (the honor society), the Psychology Student Association (PSA) and most recently, the Peer Advisory Team. Both Tau Sigma and the PSA have given me opportunities to connect with my peers outside of the classroom and also give back to the community. Through Tau Sigma and PSA, I have been able to raise money for a local breast cancer charity; For Three Sisters, and also donate food items to the Montgomery County Coalition for the Homeless.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    Following graduation, I plan to attend the University of Maryland, College Park and complete their Master's program in Special Education. I would then like to work as a Special Education teacher in a high school setting, whilst also working toward my Doctor of Education in Special Education.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    If you think you are interested in UMBC-Shady Grove, take the time to come down and visit Tim Cox, Assistant Director of Advising and Student Success, at least one semester before you plan on transferring. Tim really helped me in planning out my last semester at Montgomery College to ensure that I had the right credits and classes before transferring to UMBC-Shady Grove. I also highly recommend attending a session where you are able to meet the Program Directors; it is really useful and will help provide insight into the program that you plan on applying to. And you will also get a chance to speak with current students about their experiences to see if UMBC-Shady Grove is a good fit for you!

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    I love ballroom and Latin dancing!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I looked at several universities when I was getting ready to transfer from Montgomery College.  I chose to study here at UMBC-Shady Grove because of several reasons.  First of all, the location is convenient since I live in Rockville.  I love the short commute!  Secondly, I love the small class sizes.  I believe that establishing connections and/or relationships with your fellow students and professors is a great way to create an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and success.  Last, but not least, there are so many resources available for students, literally at our fingertips.  You do not have to travel far for assistance because UMBC-Shady Grove is part of an intimate community.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What do you like best about UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I like the small class sizes at UMBC-Shady Grove because I feel that the faculty care about the learning process of students.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I recently joined the Peer Advisory Team (PAT), an organization which helps students develop leadership skills and provides assistance to new transfer students to make their transition as smooth as possible.  I am planning to join the Tau Sigma National Honor Society and the Psychology Student Association this semester to be able to expand my network and meet other students.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After graduation, I am planning to pursue a Master’s Degree.  However, I am not yet sure which discipline to focus on in my future studies.  I have been researching as well as talking to my professors and fellow students to help me narrow my choices.  Having a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology provides so many choices to choose from as far as future and different areas of study.  Hopefully, I will be able to decide before this spring semester is over so that I can move on to a new exciting chapter in my life.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    Going to school can be stressful and it takes a lot of hard work, patience and determination, among other things.  I congratulate you for continuing your pursuit of higher education.  The best advice that I can give you is not to be afraid to seek help or advice.  Deciding what to do with your future is not an easy task.  Use every resource available to help you with the process.  I encourage you to ask questions.  Ask lots of questions!  UMBC-Shady Grove is an institution that offers the necessary tools and resources in order for you to succeed in your new endeavor.

    I am from Kansas, but no I did not grow up on a farm, and no my dog’s name is not Toto.  Also, I have been told my “accent” only comes out when I say certain words and phrases. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    For me, UMBC- Shady Grove was the obvious choice because of the convenient location and great reputation of academic excellence.  After meeting with the Social Work Program Director, Katie Morris, LCSW-C, I knew it was a great fit.  She made me feel welcomed and excited to be a part of such an amazing school and program.   I looked at a few other schools in the area, but I didn’t feel like any of them could offer me the resources and opportunities that I have here at UMBC-Shady Grove.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What do you like best about UMBC-Shady Grove? </strong><br>
    I love the small classes and the community I have been able to build here at UMBC-Shady Grove.  Being able to build relationships with my professors and see that they genuinely care about my success as a student and in the future has pushed me to expect more of myself.  Another great thing about UMBC-Shady Grove is the amazing facilities and resources like the Center for Academic Success and the Green Grove Café.  It’s really nice to not have to leave campus to get a delicious meal.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I spent my first semester figuring out which student organizations and opportunities I thought I would like to be a part of.  Currently, I am involved in the Writing Fellows Program, where I assist peers with building proficient organizational writing skills.  Good writing skills are needed in almost every profession, but especially in social work.  It helps me know that not only am I being trained in my own writing, but I am helping other students develop their skills and techniques as well.  I am also a member of the Peer Advisory Team, and will be assisting with welcoming new and prospective students to UMBC-Shady Grove. Through the Peer Advisory Team, I hope to develop my leadership skills and build strong peer and faculty relationships.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After graduating, I am hoping to continue my education in the Master’s of Social Work program at University of Maryland Baltimore.  I would like to go on to obtain my clinical licensure in social work.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    The best advice I can give to a prospective student is to figure out what your goals are and then plan the steps needed to achieve those goals.  I knew I wanted to attend UMBC-Shady Grove for over a year before I was financially ready to go back to school full-time, but I kept taking the small steps that I knew would help me once I was there.  Once you’re here, put in the effort to build relationships with your peers and professors because it will make your time and experience at UMBC-Shady Grove even more memorable and beneficial.  The professors, whether full-time or adjunct, all have great experience in the fields we hope to be working in, so this is our opportunity to soak up their knowledge and experience!

    One interesting fact about me (that I feel so fortunate about) is that I share the same birthday with my amazing mother!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove for a variety of reasons. For me, The Universities at Shady Grove (USG) more or less fell into my lap when I needed it most.  When I heard about USG, I was convinced that it was the perfect place for me. Financially, USG was much more affordable than main campus and, for someone like me who is paying for everything out of pocket, this was a huge plus! In addition, the USG campus is so close to home so it allowed me to continue to live at home and maintain my job. More importantly, I fell in love with the community. I never truly felt that sense of "school pride" until I arrived at USG. Everyone I have met (even before being an official student at USG) was incredibly warm, welcoming, and eager to make my experience in this community the best it could be.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    One of my main objectives when I decided to attend USG was to get as involved as possible. This past fall was my first semester at USG and I immediately became a part of the Psychology Student Association (PSA), Student Ambassadors, Student Event Board (SEB), and Tau Sigma Honors Society. I am now fortunate enough to add the Peer Advisory Team (PAT) to my list of activities! 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    Following graduation, my plan is to attend medical school (fingers crossed) and continue my education in hopes of becoming a pediatrician. I absolutely adore children, the medical field, and helping others! 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    My best advice to a prospective student would be to get informed and get involved! All of us know what it's like to be a new student and how overwhelming it can be. Often times that fear prevents us from asking questions and getting involved. So, from personal experience, I can say that asking questions and really becoming familiar with the many resources on campus makes everything incredibly easier! Join a club, talk to your peers, get familiar with the faculty -- just don't be afraid to become a part of the USG community.

     I always knew I wanted to attend UMBC, my only decision was whether I would attend the main campus or the Shady Grove campus. I decided to attend the Shady Grove campus as I knew I would be able to obtain leadership roles and create strong interpersonal relationship with faculty and peer.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    I am the daughter of a former diplomat.  My father was the second-secretary to the Ambassador of Nigeria to the United States.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Initially, the most attractive feature of the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) was its location and proximity to the Washington Metropolitan area. After attending a USG Open House where I met with various program directors, I learned some more information about the campus community and I decided on the Political Science program at UMBC. The Program Director, Dr. Sunil Dasgupta, was very engaging and presented a reading challenge that was designed to help me read and think critically. This was before I even applied! I was so taken by this challenge that I sought more information about UMBC-Shady Grove. </p>

<p>
    I found that in addition to its location, there are many other benefits.  Class sizes are small, so discourse is possible and students can work closely with their instructors—there is an opportunity to develop close and good relations with faculty members, relations that serve students and the community well beyond the years spent at UMBC-Shady Grove. The facilities and resources available to students are fantastic. The main hub of the campus, the Camille Kendall Academic Center, is equipped with such great technology as to facilitate the learning process for many different kinds of learners and the building itself was built with sustainability in mind. In addition, students can take advantage of the USG campus community by taking classes from other programs offered by the other universities at Shady Grove. Financial aid and scholarship opportunities are numerous and there are some wonderful opportunities specifically for prospective students.  The availability of all of these resources and the potential for an amazing learning experience ultimately led me to choosing UMBC-Shady Grove!

</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Since becoming a student at UMBC-Shady Grove, I have joined Tau Sigma, the Transfer Honor Society that recognizes high-achieving transfer students who have excelled in their time at UMBC-Shady Grove. I also joined the International Students Club, the Political Science Students Organisation (PSSO) and the Muslim Students Association. Through these organisations, I have gotten an opportunity to engage with the community, participating in events that unite the student body and benefit the community. Students are encouraged to join organizations as well create organizations they feel are beneficial to the campus community.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After graduation, I am tentatively planning to return to my country of origin, Nigeria, to engage in civil service for a year.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    Learn about the resources available to students, and take advantage of them. Do not hesitate to ask questions, the faculty and staff are there to help you reach your goals.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    I am trilingual as I speak Armenian, Russian and English - blame it on my passion for exploring new cultures!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove for many reasons. The smaller classes provide an intimate atmosphere and help me interact freely with professors and other students. The accessible parking lot and location allows for an easy, convenient commute. In addition, the vast variety of foods and drinks offered at the Green Grove Cafe during lunch hours curb my food cravings during long study hours. Another great resource is the Priddy Library which has extended hours during weekdays, allowing me to focus on studying without having to worry about the closing hours.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Currently at UMBC-Shady Grove, I am involved with the UMBC Peer Advisory Team (PAT). The Peer Advisory Team is an organization at UMBC-Shady Grove that connects prospective students with current students as they move through the transfer process. The members assist with recruitment events, provide tours of the Universities at Shady Grove and connect with prospective students interested in attending UMBC-Shady Grove. I am also a member of the Executive Board of the Psychology Student Association, serving as the Project Manager. This role includes planning events throughout the year to help our community and organize study halls. Finally, I am also a part of Tau Sigma National Honors Societies Leadership Board. The group is open to all UMBC students depending on their GPA. The group focuses on supporting the UMBC-Shady Grove community and also reaches out to help our local community through fundraising and charitable events.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After graduation I plan to apply to the Industrial Organizational Program here at UMBC - Shady Grove. This has been a long time dream for me ever since I started my journey to pursue psychology as an undergrad.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    For all prospective students, my advice is to take your time and research the different opportunities UMBC-Shady Grove has to offer. Endless resources are at the tip of your fingers.  UMBC-Shady Grove provides great opportunities to assist with your educational career, however, it will be your job to take advantage of those resources and use them to your advantage.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    I was homeschooled throughout elementary, middle, and high school. I'm also a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults), so I am fluent in American Sign Language!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I've always been very practical about my life and education. I graduated high school one year early and went straight to Frederick Community College (FCC). After FCC, I was looking for something practical, challenging, and welcoming. I found that community at UMBC-Shady Grove. Academically, I fell in love with the Social Work program and the rigorous and writing intensive courses. I also loved the small class size and intimate atmosphere where students really got to know their peers and teachers. The faculty are all SO helpful and really care about the success of students. Practically speaking, the commute and tuition were both extremely reasonable. I was also able to keep my job and other commitments at home in Frederick while also immersing myself in the culture at UMBC- Shady Grove. Socially, it felt natural and comfortable at UMBC-Shady Grove. As a transfer student, I wasn't looking for "the college experience". I already had a job, commitments at my church, a fiancé, and my own group of friends! I didn't want to leave my life and go to a large four-year school where I would just be another check mark on a list. However, I also wanted to take advantage of the opportunities a four-year school had to offer. 

</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I just joined the Peer Advisory Team which is very exciting! Since this is my second semester, I'm looking forward to being more active and joining the Social Work Student Association. I also can't wait to do my field placement internship next fall.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    I am still unsure of my exact career path, however at this point I'm interested in working in the field of mental health. Then, within five years of graduating with my Bachelor’s in Social Work, I'm hoping to come back to school and pursue my Master of Social Work with advanced standing.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    DON'T BE AFRAID! Get involved. Ask questions. Prioritize Academics. Organize. Get a planner or an online calendar. Check your UMBC email! Answer your UMBC emails. Everyone at UMBC-Shady Grove wants to help you succeed so don't be embarrassed to ask questions or get help! Commit yourself to humility, come with an open mind, be persistent and you will succeed!

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    An interesting fact about me is that I love the outdoors. I have gone camping many times throughout my life, and I would like to try camping in places like Canada or other places around the world. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose to attend UMBC-Shady Grove because Katie Morris, Social Work Program Director, came to my community college to talk about the social work program and I was instantly interested. I learned that the classes are small and made me feel comfortable to think that I will have an advantage of asking a professor for more instruction and connect with other students. The tuition is a more comfortable price than other institutions that I had come across and the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) has lots of scholarship opportunities. Lastly, some of my fellow classmates from my community college were planning to come to UMBC-Shady grove and I thought that we could all support each other in our academic journey to reach our goals of becoming social workers. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I have the privilege of being a part of the Peer Advisory Team (PAT) and I am also a part of the Bilingual Writing Program (BWP).  Many students who attend USG are bilingual and this program is intended to help students who face writing challenges and to provide them with tools to write an effective paper.  Most of my courses are writing intensive and it is helpful to have more resources such as mentors to help throughout the semester. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    My plan after graduation is go to graduate school to earn a Master’s Degree in Social Work. I am not sure exactly where I would like to work yet, but I feel I will have an idea when I start my internship in the fall semester.  Currently I feel like I would like to work with children and adolescents, but I am open to the idea of working with other populations. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    It is exciting to move forward with your education and to get closer to your goals. Try to be organized as much as possible when you have your homework for classes. Use an agenda if you can to stay on track with all your assignments.  There are many resources provided for students to succeed in class. Get acquainted with other students and form study groups. If you need help with your writing, the Center for Academic Success (CAS) helps students with their papers and the Priddy Library will provide the tools you need. Sometimes it may get overwhelming, but you will have support from the faculty/staff. There is a Center for Counseling and Consultation (CCC) to help students if they are feeling overwhelmed or if they have other personal concerns. Lastly, always stay focused but don’t forget to relax and try doing some of the fun events in campus.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    A fun fact about me is that I was born in Colombia. I came to the United States when I was three and a half years old. Since I have been in the United States, I have always made my Colombian culture a huge part of my life. A couple years ago I joined a Colombian dance group that participates in various performances around D.C, Maryland, and Virginia. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove because it is only 15 minutes away from my home. Being so close to campus allowed me to stay at the job I already had and allowed me to stay home and save money. I was also able to stay close to my family and friends I had grown up with.  I also liked that UMBC-Shady Grove offers small classroom sizes allowing students to build relationships with professors which makes it easier for student to ask for and receive help. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    During my first semester at UMBC-Shady Grove I learned about different clubs and programs offered at USG. I applied to be a part of the UMBC Peer Advisory Team (PAT) during the end of the semester and I am now a member. I really enjoy being a part of PAT because it not only gives me the chance to get to know new people but it allows me to grow as a person.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After I graduate from UMBC, I plan to continue my education and work towards a Master’s in Social Work (MSW). After I receive my master’s, I hope to work somewhere that allows me to work with and advocate for immigrants in this country.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    My advice to prospective students is to push through and ask for help. Often times, school can get stressful and you may feel like you want to quit or stop trying. At UMBC-Shady Grove there are so many resources and people willing to help, so it is important for students to look for that help. Another piece of advice I would give to prospective students is to become involved with the school as there are so many activities and programs you can be a part of. Becoming involved will help you gain new relationships and new experiences that will make your experience at UMBC-Shady Grove one-of-a-kind.

<p>
    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    One interesting fact about me is that I really like to get to know people and make friends, which is kind of ironic because when you first meet me I can be very shy. I think that is why I chose psychology as my major because it gives me the opportunity to meet new people and connect with them on a different level.  
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    One of the main reasons why I choose UMBC-Shady Grove was because of how economic the tuition and fees are compared to main campus (which we all think about as in-coming students). Also, it is beneficial because I am able to commute which allows me to stay home and save money on housing along with having a part-time job (and who doesn’t want a little bit of money in their pockets)! </p>

<p>
Another reason I chose UMBC-Shady Grove is because of the campus and its environment. UMBC-Shady Grove is a very small campus.  All of the buildings are very close together and when the weather is nice you always see students sitting outside, having lunch or just being social which makes you want to join in on all the fun!  As for the students, they are the best! Everyone is so social and willing to help you with anything that it makes the semester enjoyable and fly by. There are so many opportunities and clubs to be a part of that I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else. I’m proud to be part of UMBC-Shady Grove!

</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Due to the fact that this is only my second semester at UMBC-Shady Grove, I have not yet been able to become involved in an internship. But as of the summer of 2016 I do plan on making that change. Finding an internship is not as difficult as new, incoming students may think. About once a month emails are sent out about internships and there is no doubt that you can find help at the Center for Academic Success (CAS).</p> 

<p>
As for extracurricular activities, I would have to say joining the Peer Advisory Team (PAT). It has really helped me become more involved with the UMBC-Shady Grove community. There is no better feeling then being involved and helping other students that are in the same shoes as you were in previously. Trust me, take it from a Montgomery College Alumni who only went to school, home, and work for two years straight -- GETTING INVOLVED FEELS GREAT! 

</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    Following graduation, I hope to be accepted into the Psychology Program at the University of Maryland, and begin working on my Masters in Clinical Psychology. I also hope to become more involved in homeless shelters and help the children feel a little push of positivity to get through their day. I see myself working with kids once I receive my Master’s degree.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    My number one advice to any prospective student is to work hard and find balance. UMBC-Shady Grove is not an easy university; students here work hard and earn their grade through excellent note taking, study groups and at times, sleepless nights.  But, at the end of the day, if you want to get somewhere in life and truly succeed,  then it is 100% worth it!  With that being said, finding balance is also important. Enjoy your time at UMBC-Shady Grove, make new friends that you can grab lunch with after class and vent to each other about how stressful the semester might be.   Always remember that no matter how stressful the semester may be, the semester only lasts 15 weeks and after those fifteen weeks, you are able to enjoy your break and you are one step closer towards reaching your goal of earning a bachelor’s degree!

    I am the oldest and youngest child at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I choose UMBC-Shady Grove because I really loved UMBC’s social work program and loved how I did not necessarily have to leave my home to be able to attend UMBC. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Since I started UMBC-Shady Grove, I joined the Peer Advisory Team (PAT) and attended a few Social Work Student Association (SWSA) meetings during my spare time. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    My plans after graduation are to go back packing through Central and South America before coming back home and getting a job in juvenile corrections. After working for a year, I plan on attending graduate school to earn my Master’s in Social Work (MSW). 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    The best advice for new students is to come to UMBC-Shady Grove with an open mind and eager to get involved in your major and in the community. Just because Universities at Shady Grove (USG) is not a typical university does not mean that you don’t deserve to make your time here anything less then amazing!

    One fact about me that might be considered interesting is I have been learning how to brew beer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I found that UMBC- Shady Grove was the best choice for me because not only do the small class sizes allow me to work more closely with my professors, but also because the schools resource whether it be help writing paper in the CAS center or help doing research in the library allows me to achieve the level of quality work that I know I’m capable of despite my learning difficulties. Another big reason I choose to attend UMBC- Shady Grove is due to the fact that the small student population doesn’t stop students from being active both on this campus and on main campus if they choose to be. So I get the academic advantages of a small school but the spirit of a big one!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    While I am just now starting to become active in extracurricular activities such as the Peer Advisory Team (PAT) and the Political Science Student Association, there are tons of clubs I have yet to explore and my professors have been helping me find an internship that fits my future goals.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    While my new experiences over the last semester and a half have shifted my goals after graduation slightly, I know that I want to go on to eventually earn my graduate and doctoral degrees and pursue an academic career in archiving and writing. Directly after graduation, I plan to take some time off from school to travel and focus on my writing. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    The best advice I can give to prospective students is to truly follow your passion when it comes to choosing where to go next and what to do. School is a lot of work if you want to be successful and unless you truly love what you’re learning, it’s only going to be harder. Thanks to the experiences I have had on this campus, and with the support and inspiration of faculty who truly loves to teach and learn, I have grown so much as not only as a student and an academic, but also as a person.  While you are the one who is going to have to do the work to get the grades you want, I cannot put into words how truly special it is to have faculty and staff that want you to succeed and work to help you achieve your goals.  No matter where you decide to go to college, make sure you find what you love to do and people who both support you and challenge you to be better!

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    One interesting fact about me is that I really love different cultures because it really interests me.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Being a transfer student from Montgomery College, I chose this campus because it’s closer to home for me and it’s a size that allows me to meet new people as well as see familiar faces on a daily basis. UMBC-Shady Grove was my first choice as a transfer student because the facility is well-maintained, the commute for me is only 30 minutes to and from class, and I did not find the need to stress over room and board for the last two years of my undergraduate program. Also, the professors on this campus are excellent when it comes down to lecturing and making sure you understand the material with ease. Although the lectures are easy to follow, the professors on this campus really challenge your mental state of mind to think differently about topics you would normally be general about. This helped develop my critical thinking and research skills because professors formulate challenging questions in such a way that I cannot answer them in one or two words. The professors here really make sure I gain the true substance of what they were trying to teach by encouraging me to read and do effective research on the topics I do not understand. </p>

<p>
UMBC-Shady Grove also has a great amount of clubs that are accepting to students who are outside of their required major. For instance, our Political Science Program here usually hosts “Wednesday Wipeout.”  It’s a discussion-based group during which we bring up current news happening within our country and around the world. The great thing about this program is that both Dr. Dasgupta, Political Science Program Director, and Dr. Nolan, History Program Director, encourage other non-political science students to come and join the group because it’s such a learning and enriching opportunity to learn about politics. 
</p>

<p>
With such a small campus size, UMBC-Shady Grove acts like more of a second home for me because everyone is very friendly in the way they approach each other and we all strive and push one another to succeed. That’s the one thing I love the most about UMBC-Shady Grove – it’s not your typical college campus.  There is an equal balance of fun and work, and every student on campus has a strong determination to succeed. UMBC-Shady grove promotes a warm and welcoming setting to everyone who steps foot through their doors and I felt that vibe once I began my junior year here as a student of UMBC. 

</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Aside from being a member of the Peer Advisory Team (PAT), I am currently an intern for the Maryland General Assembly (MGA) in Annapolis Maryland for Delegate Aruna Miller. This internship opportunity has been amazing experience so far because I’m gaining a lot of experience with public policy and gaining close perspective to what it could be like to become a Delegate for Montgomery County. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    Once I graduate, I have plans to start a career working within the field of public policy, regardless if it is on national or local level. Other possible careers I am pursuing after graduation include becoming a Diplomat for the United States. This is a dream because I have always loved different cultures and I always have considered traveling to different parts of the world if the opportunity presents itself.  I also plan to attend graduate school and obtain a graduate degree in one of the following fields of public policy, international relations, and or information systems. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    The advice I would provide to a prospective student attending UMBC-Shady Grove is to work to improve your reading and writing skills because most classes require a good amount of it. It’s not something overbearing at all, but these two set of skills play a major role in how well you understand the material and how well you do in classes over all.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    In 2012, I traveled to Phoenix, Arizona and left from there to complete a road trip to the Grand Canyon National Park.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove because the staff members, advisors, and my Program Director were there for me since day one. In addition, while I served as a student aide in the English Department at Montgomery Community College -Takoma Park, professors encouraged me to transfer to UMBC-Shady Grove because it has a great reputation, and they were right! I am blessed and proud to be part of UMBC-Shady Grove.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What do you like best about UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    What I like best about UMBC-Shady Grove is the small size classes. Also, I love the fact that professors are there not only to teach but also to advise students with whatever they need.  During my first semester at UMBC-Shady Grove, I was super stressed because I did not know what to expect, but staff members and peers served as my number one support in every step I took to overcome my fears.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Since this is my second semester at UMBC-Shady Grove, I am still working on getting more involved in school activities. In the meantime, I have the honor to be part of the UMBC Peer Advisory Team (PAT), and I try to help out at the Campus Kitchens Project, which is an awesome project to volunteer for at The Universities at Shady Grove. Every semester students have the opportunity to help the local community by providing a meal to single mother families once a month. Volunteers help with planning menus, cooking, and driving the food to children and families. They also organize fundraisers to buy food supplies. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work, I want to find a position that will provide me the training I need to become a better, more experienced social worker. I would also like to become a missionary and use my tools as a social worker to help serve individuals in other parts of the globe. I am considering going back to school to pursue a Master’s in Social Work.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    My advice to prospective students is to never give up on your education, especially if you have a learning disability and/or financial limitations.  There are many resources like financial aid and Student Support Services that are available to any student. In addition, the Center for Counseling and Consultation at The Universities at Shady Grove helps students dealing with stress, anxiety, personal concerns, etc. Do not be afraid to ask for help as there are many resources available to students that are very useful.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    I was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), formerly known as Zaire. I speak French as well as two other local dialects. I have a great sense of humor and I rarely take myself too seriously unless I have to, of course, at which point I will switch on the “seriousness” in an instance. I think humor is the greatest remedy to world problems because if we can all put aside our differences and laugh together, we will discover that our commonalities supersede our differences.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I chose UMBC-Shady Grove because it is closer to home so there is no need to commute a long distance. </p>
<p>
This is especially important for me because I work full-time and attend school full-time. The Universities at Shady Grove are by far the best option for working students, not only because of the sense of community, but also because of the many opportunities available to students such as internships with government institutions like the U.S. Department of State, large private companies like Morgan Stanley, non-profit organizations like United Way, think tanks like the Brookings Institute as well as lobbying firms, all within the DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) area. </p>
<p>
The faculty and staff members are the greatest I have yet to meet anywhere. The resources for success are endless and professors are readily available to assist students. I also wanted to attend school locally in order to engage in the local community and take advantage of the many opportunities our area has to offer. The Universities at Shady Grove, as a whole, has been heavily involved in our local community. Last year, for example, the Universities at Shady Grove hosted a Food Recovery Event with students from University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) who collaborated with the Corporate Volunteer Council of Montgomery County to increase alertness on ways to prevent food waste.  
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What do you like best about UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    I like the faculty and staff.  In addition, the buildings are awesome and clean and the technological resources are vast and easily accessible. It is also a community-based campus with well-established roots in Montgomery County. Overall, The Universities at Shady Grove provide a unique blend of nine University of Maryland System institutions with a wide array of programs and accessibility to the main campus of each institution.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    This is my second semester at UMBC-Shady Grove and I am a new member of the UMBC Peer Advisory Team. I regularly attend Wipe-Out-Wednesday (WOW) headed by the Political Science Department Director, Dr. Sunil Dasgupta. WOW is an open forum platform where we discuss a wide array of issues -- anything from culinary to current political events. It is a forum widely dominated with debates and persuasion and it provides students the opportunity to have intellectual discussions with professors. It is a good way for students to get accustomed to participating in open forum debates and voicing their thoughts on political as well as historical matters. I am also looking to reactivate our Political Science Club here at the Shady Grove Campus as well as do some volunteer work during the upcoming summer break, all while completing an internship with a non-profit organization within the DMV area.

    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    I plan to attend graduate school for international development if I do not immediately enter the workforce. I want to study international development in order to provide my time and effort to help the many underprivileged individuals around the world who are not afforded the same opportunities we have here in the United States.  I hope to change the lives of individuals for the better along the way.

    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    My advice to prospective students is to have a plan in place before entering a four year institution. UMBC-Shady Grove is a great place to develop your skills and knowledge. Take advantage of all the opportunities and resources available to you as there are many and do not leave any stones unturned. UMBC-Shady Grove is a small community which provides students the advantage to make connections and build networks. You will find many students with similar interests who may eventually become your friends, as relationships forged today become lifetime friendships tomorrow. UMBC-Shady Grove has an environment that is designed for you to succeed, but you have to want to be successful because no one else will do the work for you. If you are serious and dedicated to your academics, you will never lack the necessary assistance for your success. Most importantly, plan ahead and you will get ahead.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    While finishing my degree at UMBC-Shady Grove, I also hold a retail job.  In between school and work, I found time to go to my first MagFest event this year at National Harbor.  MagFest (Music and Gaming Fest) is a convention where people of many interests gather, including but not limited to music, gaming, comics, and fictional genres. Another interesting fact is that I affiliate with the Log Cabin Republicans.

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    UMBC-Shady Grove offers students hoping to earn their bachelor’s degree the ability to transfer smoothly from community colleges and other institutions. I choose UMBC-Shady Grove because UMBC offers a great program in my field of study, political science, which will help propel me into my chosen career path. The small classes, engaging staff, and resources offer a great learning environment.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What do you like best about UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    There are a lot of unique traits about UMBC-Shady Grove. My learning experience is supported by the modern classrooms and faculty who are experienced in their field. Being equipped with modern study aids and insightful instructors is certainly my favorite aspect of UMBC-Shady Grove.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Outside of classes, I am a member of the UMBC Peer Advisory Team (PAT). In addition, I attend the UMBC-Shady Grove Wednesday Wipeout sessions, a weekly meeting consisting of political science and other UMBC-Shady Grove students who discuss a wide range of current event topics.  I also keep in tune with other campus events.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    Once I graduate, I have a few plans for potential career starters. I hope to work for the Library of Congress, in a local Congressional office, or obtain an internship in Annapolis, MD. Being so near to DC, I recognize that this is truly an ideal area for all things political.  Running for public office may be in my future, however, just being in close proximity to political events enables  me to feel involved, connected, and engaged in the system.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    The best advice I can give to future students is take as many non-major or general education classes you need before transferring to UMBC-Shady Grove. Once at UMBC-Shady Grove, I have found that it’s best to really hone in on and concentrate on your major-specific courses. Also, I recommend that students master the three major types of citation when writing papers: MLA, APA, and Chicago style.

    <strong>An interesting personal fact…</strong><br>
    I like to paint in my spare time, and one of my art pieces was published in a children’s book.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Why did you choose UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    After graduating from Montgomery College-Rockville with an Associates degree, I made the decision to apply to UMBC-Shady Grove for several reasons.  UMBC-Shady Grove provides me with quality education, and the convenience of a campus which is close to home.  Students at the Shady Grove campus get all of the same academic resources as students on the main campus, with the added bonus of having eight other Universities contributing to the campus. The smaller class sizes at Shady Grove also allow a more intimate environment in which it is easy to make connections with both peers and faculty.  Another factor which made UMBC-Shady Grove an attractive option is that everyone on campus is a transfer student, which means that everyone else would have a similar educational background to me.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What internships and/or extracurricular activities have you been involved with at UMBC-Shady Grove?</strong><br>
    Currently, I am a Peer Advisory Team (PAT) student representative, and serve as the treasurer on the Psychology Student Association Executive Board.  This semester I am planning to join the Tau Sigma National Honor Society, and am also searching for a summer internship.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What are your plans following graduation?</strong><br>
    After graduation, I hope to secure a stable job in the field of psychology.  Ultimately my goal is to attend graduate school, but I plan to spend a few years getting professional experience beforehand.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is your advice for prospective students?</strong><br>
    My main piece of advice to prospective students is to attend a UMBC-Shady Grove open house, and to get as much information as possible about the program to which you wish to apply.  UMBC-Shady Grove offers its students an endless amount of resources and opportunities, so the best thing to do is to take advantage of them!  Get involved as much as possible, make the most of your education, and don’t forget to have some fun along the way!
