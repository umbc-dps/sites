                	<p>This course uses film to explore myth and reality in the "Age of Revolution" during the late 18th to early 19th centuries. Students will compare depictions of independence and nation building in films on the American, French, Haitian, and Latin America Revolutions. Movies about these different founding moments will be used to examine how film can convey historical accuracy, perpetuate "creation story" mythology, and impose modern political ideals onto the past. Although the course will be taught completely online, it will rely heavily on student discussion and interaction through Blackboard. </p>
