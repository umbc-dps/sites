    <p>As our “neighbor to the north,” Baltimore offers wide-ranging opportunities as a living classroom where students can discover many facets of this historic and complex city. Students will have opportunities to engage in hands-on experiential learning by exploring its urban neighborhoods and rich and complex racial history, its architectural heritage and vibrant street culture, its fine art museums and civically engaged contemporary art, its diverse musical and literary traditions fostered both within historic institutions and in urban public places.  </p>

  <div id="health" style="display:none;">
    <p>The role of the social sciences in health and medicine has grown significantly as it has started to recognize the connection between health, the individual and society. Biological or genetic factors are no longer considered the primary predictors of health outcomes, and with the inclusion of social, economic, gender, race, age and psychological factors providers are better able to predict and assist in reversing some of the adverse trends. This program will offer students the blueprint to think about health outside the box, and really consider all of the factors that affect one’s life from personal, to social and political by exploring issues including health disparities, health behaviors, health policy, health care professions, and health care delivery among others. Understanding the social dimensions of health is critical to addressing health and illness in the 21st century.  </p>
