          </div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>This course will review the chemistry of living systems, with an emphasis on topics of biotechnological and biomedical interest.  The course will also survey the methods used in modern biochemistry, so that students will be able to understand the connection between empirical data and the established facts and concepts presented in the course. The first part of the course will focus on the relationship between structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and membranes.  Important chemical concepts relevant to these molecules and their components (amino acids, nucleotides, etc.), such as pH and weak chemical interactions, will be presented.  After an introduction to enzyme kinetics, the course will concentrate on the principles and pathways of intermediary metabolism.  The final topics will be concerned with informational biochemistry &ndash; DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription, as well as protein synthesis. </p>

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>This course explores the molecular basis of cell structure, organization, and function.  Topics include genetic mechanisms (DNA replication, repair, and recombination, genome organization, and regulation of gene expression), internal cellular organization and activity (the cytoskeleton, membrane structure/function, cytoplasmic organelles, sorting to intracellular compartments, vesicular trafficking, and intracellular communication), cell growth and reproduction (the cell cycle and cell division), and cells in the context of the organism (cell junctions and adhesion, extracellular matrix, cell motility, and cell-cell signaling).  An emphasis will be placed on experimental methods and strategies applied to molecular and cell biological investigations. Text and lecture materials will be supplemented with readings from the current literature, and significant class time will be allotted to discussions and student presentations.  <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> BTEC 650 or equivalent course in biochemistry

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>A lecture, discussion and project-based course that focuses on the molecular and genetic tools used to analyze and modify genetic material and used to modify organisms to produce desired small molecules and proteins.  Topics will include the properties and uses of biotechnology-useful enzymes, sequencing techniques, PCR, cloning vectors and hosts, DNA and protein microarrays, directed mutagenesis, and the manipulation of  expression (and its levels) of particular gene products.  The experimental and model systems that will be studied include bacteria, yeast, plant, and higher mammals. Extensive use of the Internet&rsquo;s resources and on-line journals will be also expected. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> BTEC 651 or permission of instructor

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>A chemical engineering course covering basic process engineering, from the milliliter to the kiloliter scale.  Topics relevant to the commercial bioprocesses used in the food, pharmaceutical and waste treatment industries will be introduced.

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>This seminar-style course is an in-depth exploration of emerging technologies, innovations, and new products that are noteworthy to the biotechnology industry.  The course focuses on examining and critiquing what new scientific discoveries will likely impact the industry and in what ways.  Literature research expands and deepens the student’s understanding of key fields within the life science area and allows the student to gain more in-depth knowledge on subjects that are relevant to their careers.  Oral presentation and written papers help to refine the student’s communications skills.

  <h4><a href="#656" id="656"></a>BTEC 656: Experimental Design [3]<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
          </div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>This course introduces the basic concepts which underlie the design of experiments.  The use of statistical methods to discriminate between real effects (those caused by changes in controlled variables) and experimental error in systems which are inherently noisy are taught.  Statistically designed experimental programs which can help test many variables simultaneously are very efficient tools for developing empirical mathematical models which accurately describe physical and chemical processes.  These techniques are readily applied to production plant, pilot plant and laboratory systems, and should be a part of every practicing life science professional’s repertoire.  At the end of this course, the student will be able to select an appropriate experimental design for the problem at hand, to set up, conduct and analyze the results of statistically designed experiments, and to understand the statistical basis for these techniques.

            <p>This course teaches the fundamentals of management and managerial leadership and communication. Managers juggle operations, finance, information technology, strategy, and projects, yet much of their success depends less on their own direct input than on their ability to enlist the active involvement of others: direct reports, other managers, other team members, and those above them on the organizational chart. It is imperative, therefore, that managers be adept at influencing those over whom they have no formal authority as well as guiding and directing those who report to them.  </p>
