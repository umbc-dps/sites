      <h1>Winter Survival Guide</h1>
      <h2>Presented by <a href="http://umbc.edu/winter">UMBC Winter Session</a></h2>
<p>
Starting at a new school, whether full-time or just during winter session, can be a difficult transition, but no one ever said you had to go it alone. Sometimes a little help and some insider information can go a long way. So, for Winter Session 2016, we hit the streets and began polling students, online &amp; in-person on various aspects of campus life to make the transition a little easier for freshman, transfers, and visiting students. We received <a href="http://my.umbc.edu/groups/summerwinter/posts?tag=poll" target="_blank">hundreds of responses</a>!</p>

<p>So if you’d like to learn a little more about the best food or the best study spots on campus, the UMBC Winter Survival Guide is your go-to source for the kind of insider information you won’t find anywhere else.</p>

<h3>
<p>
Everyone knows the best way to survive as a college student is with a good cup of coffee (or 10)! But the real question is which coffee is the best coffee at UMBC? Poll #1 asked students just that. My personal favorite is Starbucks, because they do a really good job at making coffee not taste like coffee.</p>

<p>
According to the results it’s clear Starbucks takes the cake, ranking as number one with 114 votes. However, some students (51) still think that even though Starbucks tastes better than your average cup of Joe, Au Bon Pan is the place to go to wake up and get your day started. Pure La Vida and the Coffee Shoppe in the Administration Building finished with 23 and 14 votes, respectively. What do you think?</p>

<h3>
<p>Every campus has its secrets, and UMBC is no different. Whether it’s the best place to dine with the shortest lines and awesome food, or cozy corners that nobody would expect to find, our campus has it all. For poll #2 we asked the students to divulge the best kept secrets UMBC students have been hiding. </p>

<p>Some of the results might surprise you. Do you know about the campus cats that are being removed from campus or the free massages and acupuncture at the University Health Center? A few of the results might be helpful. Did you know that Papa John's takes flex for payment options or that the Coffee Shoppe in the Administration Building serves breakfast? Other results might even get you in the mood to explore. Have you visited  Pig Pen Pond or the UMBC’s observatory (which happens to be the largest in MD)? </p>

<p>Regardless of what secrets you might uncover one thing is for sure, UMBC is full of them. What’s yours?</p>

<h3>
<p>Everyone has their own version of what they consider “comfort food.” For some it’s food that gives you that warm cozy feeling inside. For others it’s food that’s probably not considered the healthiest option for consumption. Although everyone defines comfort food differently, we can  all agree on one thing - nothing beats it.</p>

<p>For poll #3 we asked  students where they find the best comfort food on campus. The results led us with the top two places: Au Bon Pan (37 votes) and Chic-Fil-A (33), and True Grit’s and the Admin Building tied with 21 votes each. What’s your choice?</p>

<p>One of the best things about UMBC is its location! Not only is the campus beautiful with its own hidden wonders, like Pig Pen Pond, but UMBC is also right next to Baltimore. What could be more convenient?</p>

<p>For poll #4, we asked UMBC students to list some of their favorite spots - places they’d take visitors. The top three results were the Inner Harbor, Ellicott City, and the Performing Arts Building here on campus. But that’s not all there is to UMBC or Baltimore. What’s your choice?</p>

<h3>
<p>I think we can all agree that campus food is not always everyone’s favorite. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t some great options around campus, especially at the UMBC dining hall, True Grit’s. For poll #5, we asked students what they thought was the best food at True Grit’s. The top four choices were omelettes, french or waffle fries, desserts, and pizza. My personal favorite is when they do theme nights, like Taco night. Everyone gets festive and there is more than enough food to go around. </p>

<p>We've all got that place on campus where we like to spread the books (or laptops or tablets) out and study. My personal favorite is the top floor of the library because it’s quiet and you can get in the zone and focus. And the students agree. The top floor of the library also happens to be the top choice for the poll #6 where we asked students to tell us their favorite study spots around campus.</p>

<p>Other top results were the dorms or apartments, the library third and fourth floors, the library first floor or LRC, and the library seventh floor, followed by the second floor of the library and the performing arts center, which tied with ten votes. </p>

<p>For poll #7, we asked students how they recover from a cold. At the top of the list came an oldie, but a goodie: sleep and rest.Other top suggestions included drinking tea, eating chicken noodle soup, and taking some over the counter medications from  Health Services.

<h3>
<p>There is nothing quite like snuggling up during a cold winter night and watching your favorite holiday movie. However, it’s often hard to remember to take a few moments to enjoy the holiday season when you’re running round the library finishing up last minute papers, and pulling all nighters to study for exams. It’s stressful just thinking about it. Holiday movies especially, are a great way to relax and detox from the college grind.</p>

<p>For poll #8, we asked students to name their favorite holiday movie. Elf topped the list, with classic family favorites like Home Alone, “It’s A Wonderful Life,” “Nightmare Before Christmas,” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” rounding out the list.</p>

<h3>
<p>Holiday cheer, as great as it is, sometimes leads to a few unwanted holiday pounds. And who’s to blame with all the pies, cakes, and cookies laying around? But as college students, it’s sometimes hard to stay on your A game when trying to make the grade. </p>

<p>For poll #9, we asked students what the best way to lose holiday pounds. Most students suggested to get moving or hit the gym to get some much needed exercise. Another popular option was portion control, which means maybe not eating <em>all</em> the cookies. And surprisingly some students responded “just don’t,” because, at the end of the day, you have to eat!</p>

Food and sleep were amongst the most popular choices, with movies and tv shows on Netflix or Hulu, playing games or an instrument, doing some form of exercise, and an expensive yet personal favorite - shopping - rounding out the list.</p>
