          </div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>Database Management Systems (DBMS) have been dominated by relational systems (RDBMS) for over 30 years. Due to changes in hardware, bandwidth, and use case, systems are changing. Multiple processors, gigabit network speeds, and the Internet as a platform for distributed systems are changing the way computing gets done. RDBMS is not being superseded, but many so-called â€˜non-standardâ€™ system architectures are now being developed and deployed for specific application classes. We will look at a developing category of such systems sometimes referred to as â€˜NoSqlâ€™ systems that are becoming important for semi-structured information in web applications. We will cover current systems from conceptual and practical standpoints. We will read papers on representative systems and do simple programming against the databases. Students should have taken a relational database class, a programming class, and be familiar with elementary web development with html and javascript.

          </div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>The integration of systems and the seamless exchange of information stored in them provides an answer to a very common problem when organizations merge and inherit information systems that are not compatible with each other. Data systems and information should easily interoperate for the success of the organization. This course investigates the various technologies in the field of information integration with an emphasis on semantic interoperation of systems. Topics that are covered include: Modeling Data Semantics, Semantic Interoperability, Metadata, Semantic Integration Patterns, Context-Awareness, Semantic Networks, Mediation and Wrapper techniques, Data Warehouses, Integration Servers, etc. Students will keep abreast of the latest technologies and research on data semantics, information integration, and also gain practical experience integrating information from disparate and heterogeneous systems.

  <h4><a href="#733" id="733"></a>IS 733: Data Warehousing and Data Mining [3]<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
          </div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive discussion on using organizational databases to enable decision support through warehousing and mining of data. This course will provide an in depth understanding of the technical, business, and research issues in each of these two areas. Issues in data warehousing include designing multi-dimensional data model, cleansing and loading of data, determining refresh cycles and methods, administrative aspects of running a data warehouse including efficient data retrieval using bitmap and join indexes, reporting, ad hoc querying, and multi-dimensional operations such as slicing, dicing, pivoting, drill-down, and roll-up operations. Areas with data mining will include justifying the need for knowledge recovery in databases, data mining methods such as clustering, classification, Bayesian networks, association rules, and visualization. New areas of research and development in data mining warehousing will also be discussed.
