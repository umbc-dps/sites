	  <div class="intro"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Intro" -->UMBC  Collegium Musicum is a performance ensemble dedicated to exploring and  performing vocal and instrumental music from European Medieval, Renaissance,  and Baroque periods, sampling musical repertoires created between 800 and 1750.  Open to all students with musical ability. Permission of instructor required. <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
	  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Text" -->
	  <p>Under the  direction of Dr. Lindsay Johnson, the UMBC Collegium Musicum is a unique  ensemble in the Visual and Performing Arts program and is devoted to the  performance of Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque music. Members meet in  ensembles of various sizes to study and perform period vocal and instrumental  music. Students are given the opportunity to sing in a variety of conventional  and extended vocal styles, and to play recorder, krummhorn, racket, cornetto,  shawm, sackbut, viol da gamba, vielle, harp, organetto, lute, and other  historical instruments from the UMBC Department of Music's collection of  instruments. Emphasis is given to the study of musical style, performance  practice, singing and playing one-on-a-part, and excellence in ensemble  performance. This ensemble is designed for all students who are interested in  either performing and/or learning about the music and instruments of these  periods with an emphasis on performance.</p>
	  <p>The course  samples sacred and secular music from expansive and culturally diverse European  regions ranging from Andalusian Spain to pre- and post-Reformation Germany and  England. Participants are exposed not only to a broad variety of music, but  also to the study of cultural influences through the use of primary source  materials such as fascimiles of musical manuscripts, as well as literary  sources that shed light on music; music-making; dance; courtly, ecclesiastical,  and folk entertainment; and on art in society in general. For the music major  or minor, the course functions as a complement to the required period history  survey courses; as an elective for the non-music major, it provides perspective  on the history of European art music through performance within a cultural  framework.</p>
	  <p class="subhead"><strong>Auditions</strong></p>
	  <p>Students wishing to take part in the Collegium need to demonstrate musical  proficiency on their instrument or in singing. The Collegium welcomes musicians  who are interested in performing Baroque music, where &quot;modern&quot;  instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, flute, oboe, bassoon, etc. are  used. Students who wish to participate using medieval and Renaissance  instruments (and who are not already proficient on those instruments) should  audition on an instrument that closely approximates the &quot;early&quot;  instrument (for example: students wishing to play the recorder might audition  on flute or clarinet, while students wishing to play cornetto would audition on  trumpet or cornet, and students interested in playing shawm could audition on  oboe). <br />
	    </p>
	  <p>To  schedule an audition please contact Dr. Lindsay Johnson at (410) 455-2941 or by  e-mail <a href="mailto:lindsaymaureenjohnson@gmail.com">lindsaymaureenjohnson@gmail.com </a></p>
	  <p class="subhead"><strong>Rehearsal</strong></p>
	  <p>Locations and Schedule Rehearsals always take place in the Fine Arts building.  Given that the Collegium consists of a number of small ensembles, there is quite  a bit of flexibility in scheduling rehearsals. In a majority of cases, the  members of an ensemble decide when to meet. </p>
	  <p class="subhead"><strong>Instruments</strong></p>
	  <p>As in any ensemble, participants are expected to play their own instruments;  however, the Collegium will provide &quot;early&quot; instruments to students  involved in ensembles performing medieval and Renaissance repertoire. </p>
	  <p class="subhead"><strong>Performances </strong></p>
	  <p>The Collegium musicum generally performs one recital every semester and  occasionally gives performances in various area locations and events. </p>
	  <p class="subhead"><strong>Questions </strong></p>
