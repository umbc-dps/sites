	  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Text" -->
	  <p>The  band is comprised of the standard band instrumentation which includes  woodwinds, brass and percussion (field drums and drum set) plus  electric bass and guitar. Membership is by audition, and participation  is open to all UMBC students. A stipend is offered for playing home  games.
	  <p class="subhead"><strong>Rehearsals and Games</strong></p>
	  <p>Rehearsals are Wednesday nights at 7 PM. Rehearsals are important. We  will do weekly rehearsals to learn new music and keep our musical  skills sharp. As we get into the season we will not schedule rehearsals  when we are playing the games. Band members are required to attend  rehearsals and games plus any extra performances as required by the  director. If you need to miss a rehearsal, it is your responsibility to  inform the director by e-mail or phone and to make appropriate  arrangements with music or equipment so that other members are able to  perform in your absence. Stipends are paid to band members for  performances at basketball games.</p>
	  <p>Pep  Band members are responsible for their own instruments and music plus  set up and tear down at games. Band members will be in place ready to  go one half-hour before each game. Lateness to rehearsals and games  will not be tolerated. Those not ready to start playing at the 30  minute mark will be considered late. A combination of two lateness or  two not excused absences will result in a dropping of a letter grade.  This also will affect your stipend for playing the games.</p>
	  <p>Music  is to be learned as required. You are required to memorize UMBC Riser  and the Star-Spangled Banner plus any other music as required. It is  the responsibility of the band member to have their music at rehearsal  and games.</p>
	  <p>E-mails  and the website are the best way to communicate with all band members.  Students must have a school e-mail address and an optional secondary  address if desired. Students are responsible for checking e-mails and  responding back when asked. Notices sent via e-mail will be considered  official notices from the director. If a rehearsal or game needs to be  canceled, notification will be made by e-mail as early as possible or  game will be canceled at the very last minute.</p>
