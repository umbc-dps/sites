	  <p>We are especially excited to call the new Performing Arts and  Humanities Building our home from August 2014.   Only a short distance up the hill from the Fine Arts Building, we have a  beautiful new Concert Hall that seats 375, a black box space called The Music  Box (seating 80) that will house smaller-scale performances, a suite of  Recording Studios to support the oldest and most developed program in music  technology in the State, and numerous practice rooms, rehearsal rooms,  classrooms, studio teaching rooms, and faculty offices.  Here is a photo (by Ken Wyner) of the Concert  Hall:</p>

	  <p>Our Curriculum:</p>
	  <p>UMBC's Music Department provides the one-on-one attention undergraduates need to flourish as young musicians within the resources of a small research university. We provide excellent large ensembles that unite musicians from across campus, regardless of major (the UMBC Symphony, the UMBC Wind Ensemble, Camerata, The Jubilee Singers, and The Jazz Ensemble), balanced with small classes in music theory, musicianship, music history, and music education.  In addition, small performing ensembles such as Chamber Players, the New Music Ensemble, the Percussion Ensemble, the Vocal Arts Ensemble (opera scenes), and a number of jazz combos, allow students to hone their musical skills in a small group setting. </p>
	  <p>UMBC music faculty are renowned musicians who also love to teach. We are especially keen to build entrepreneurial skills in our students so that they are prepared to contribute as musicians to societies of the 21st-century as highly-skilled innovators. Examples of this initiative include our Arts in Education course (modeled on the Lincoln Center program in New York), a Careers in Music course, and a number of internships and side-by-side collaborations with our faculty and other professional musicians.</p>
	  <p>A new internship to be implemented during Fall 2014for our undergraduate music education students will take place at schools in Baltimore City that are part of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra’s OrchKids program – an award winning after-school program that is modeled on Venezuela’s El Sistema (an innovative and widely successful initiative in music education). This partnership between UMBC Music and the Baltimore Symphony follows two others for graduate students – a Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Program in Music Entrepreneurship (1-year), in partnership with the BSO’s Education Department; and the BSO/UMBC Academy for Music Educators (a one-week summer program that includes classes pertinent to music teachers, an opportunity to conduct the BSO in rehearsal, and a side-by-side concert with the BSO).</p>
	  <p>Our students also join faculty in their research.  One exciting new interdisciplinary project undertaken is “Symphony Interactive” – an I-Pad app thatenhances audience engagement at orchestral events by providinglive program notes during a performance.  Led by Dr. Linda Dusman (Professor of Music) and Eric Smallwood (Assistant Professor of Visual Arts), and joined by student interns, the SI team has collaborated with the UMBC Imaging Research Center, the UMBC Symphony, and the National Orchestral Institute in developing and testing this app, and recently was awarded a Maryland Innovation Grant to support further work.</p>

	  <p>UMBC Music also values international experiences for our students. The Department has established an exchange program with the Nicolini Conservatorio in Piacenza, Italy (located only 1 hour from Milan!), where students can study for a semester.</p>
	  <p>So, whatever your musical interest or expertise, please visit us! We look forward to meeting you!!</p>
