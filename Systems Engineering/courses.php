          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>The  Systems Engineering Principles course provides an introduction to the  discipline of Systems Engineering and Systems Architecting. Key industry  standards for the &ldquo;The Systems Engineering Process&rdquo; are taught and used  throughout the course. The course describes how the SE process is implemented  in standard life cycle models and through various standard organizational  structures. This course introduces Model-Based Systems Engineering concepts, <em>e.g</em>., DoDAF, UML, and SysML. System  engineering technical process topics range from Requirements Definition through  system Verification and Validation. System engineering management process  topics include: Decision Analysis, Technical Planning, Risk Management, and  Interface Management. The course also covers aspects of project management: Integrated  Product Teams, technical performance measurement, earned value measurement, and  work breakdown structures. Students will develop a requirements document, and an  integrated architecture, and a System Engineering Plan (SEP). Homework and  Exams are designed to provide the opportunity to practice the concepts learned  in class. </p>

          </div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>The  System Architecture and Design course focuses on the role of the systems  architect in the system development life cycle. In the operational analysis  phase, the emphasis is on understanding the context of the system within the  larger customer problem area, and the identification of requirements that  influence system partitioning. In the functional analysis phase, the  emphasis is on the dependencies between processing steps. In the architectural  design phase, the emphasis is on partitioning the system into generic  components, and ultimately instantiating them into physical components.  A  precision landing system is used throughout the course as a common case study.  Within the classroom sessions, a search and rescue system is used. Three  presentations by each group are given to simulate: (1) RFI review, (2) SRR, and  (3) SDR. These reviews progressively reveal each group&rsquo;s proposed solution to  the precision landing system for a mythical country with unique complicating  characteristics. <strong>Prerequisite</strong>:  ENEE 660. ENEE 660 may be taken concurrently with instructor permission.</p>

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>The  Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis  (MS&amp;A) course covers the use of modeling,  simulation, and analysis in the development and test of systems. The course  covers leading MS&amp;A activities, architecting simulations, and making  decisions based on statistical analysis of the simulation results. The  techniques discussed in class are motivated through the use of examples. Typical modeling problems discussed include performance,  cost, reliability, and maintainability modeling.  Students will develop simple models and  simulations using MATLAB and complete several course projects. <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:  ENEE 660, ENEE 669. The ENEE 669 class requirement may be waived by passing the  Mathematics and MATLAB Fundamentals Proficiency Exam.  See the instructor for details.</p>

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>The  System Implementation, Integration, and Test course is a follow-on to  ENEE 661. The course covers the translation of design specifications into  product elements, the integration of these elements into a system, and the  verification that the resulting system performs as intended in its operational  environment.  The course follows the product development life cycle beyond  system architecture and design. The system is decomposed into component level  elements suitable for software coding and hardware fabrication. These elements  are then individually tested and gradually integrated together as the various  modules and sub-systems are subjected to unit test, verification and  validation. Eventually the full system goes through Operational Test and  Evaluation, and finally makes it into production and operation. This course  covers the System Engineer role, activities and processes that are needed  during this phase of the product development cycle. Areas of study will include  technical planning, requirement &amp; interface management, standards,  technical performance measures, technical evaluation, technical readiness,  implementation, integration, verification, validation, production, transition  to operation and complexity. <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:  ENEE 660 and ENEE 661 or consent of instructor.</p>

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>This  timely course focuses on incorporating security in the initial phases of  architecting Systems and Services. The goal is to teach our systems engineers  and architects how to develop systems and system of systems (SoS) that have  native security as a foundational component that is dynamic and scales to  mission need. Consideration of data-at-rest, data-in-transit and processed data  is a critical architectural facet. Incorporating data tagging and digital  policy-based routing to facilitate secure data flow is an important aspect of  securing data. The course assumes that the students have initial knowledge of  systems engineering and architecture and are familiar with needs and basic  methods of securing systems. The course will incorporate student participation  researching risks and mitigation approaches in current and recent past systems  that have been deployed and their impact on stakeholders. Lessons learned are  highlighted and practical methods considered in order to allow direct  application. <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> ENEE 660 </p>

            <p>This  two-credit course provides students the opportunity to deepen their  understanding of the systems engineering processes introduced in ENEE 660.  Specifically, this course provides an in-depth study of the systems engineering  processes outlined in the International Standard for Systems and Software  Engineering (ISO/IEC 15288:2008), the International Council on Systems  Engineering (INCOSE) Handbook, and the INCOSE Systems Engineering Body of  Knowledge. This course will emphasize that Systems Engineering Technical  Processes operate within the envelope of the Project as dictated by Contracts  as set forth by an Organization. In the end, the student will have a good  understanding and appreciation of the process framework required to create  man-made systems. As a part of this course, students will select, research, and  report on systems engineering process areas of particular importance to them. <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> ENEE 660 </p>

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>In  this course, the student performs in an industry-based work environment on a SE  project. The project spans the essential phases of the System Life Cycle and  results in the development of a simulation model of the objective system.  During the course of system development, engineering artifacts are created to  substantiate system development. A final summary technical report summarizing  the artifacts and simulation results are compiled in a form representative of a  professional report in partial satisfaction of course requirements. Starting six weeks before the beginning of  the semester, students form Integrated Product Teams, usually not exceeding 5  students per team. During the six weeks before the semester begins, the team  prepares a proposal for the project that is submitted to the instructor for  approval. The advisor may approve the  project proposal, subject to adjustment, as needed. To increase the realism of  the environment, an industry mentor may collaborate with the advisor during the  periodic milestone reviews of the project. <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:  ENEE 660, ENEE 661, ENEE 662 or ENEE 669, ENEE 663, or consent of instructor. </p>

          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>A wide range of applications such as disaster management, military and security have fueled the interest in sensor networks during the past few years. Sensors are typically capable of wireless communication and are significantly constrained in the amount of available resources such as energy, storage and computation. Such constraints make the design and operation of sensor networks considerably different from contemporary wireless networks, and necessitate the development of resource conscious protocols and management techniques. This course provides a broad coverage of challenges and latest research results related to the design and management of wireless sensor networks. Covered topics include network architectures, node discovery and localization, deployment strategies, node coverage, routing protocols, medium access arbitration, fault-tolerance, and network security.</p>
