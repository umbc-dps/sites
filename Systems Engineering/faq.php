<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      
  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>What  are the academic requirements for admission to the Systems Engineering Master&rsquo;s  Program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
   <p>Applicants must have a B.S. degree, in engineering, computer science, information systems or related discipline. Professional work experience is desirable, but not required. The minimum GPA for admission to UMBC graduate programs is 3.0.  Domestic applicants with a lower GPA may be considered for admission to the certificate program. Each case is reviewed individually.</p>
 </div>
 

      
  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>Can  all five Systems Engineering certificate courses be applied to a Master&rsquo;s degree?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
   <p>All five of the Systems Engineering certificate courses apply to the M.S. in Systems Engineering and the M.S. in Engineering Management degrees.<br>
   </p></div>
   
 
      
  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>What  courses are scheduled for the next semester?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
   <p>View the <a href="schedule.php">schedule of SE courses</a> for  the current and future semester (when it is available).
   </p>  
      </div>

  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>Are  any Systems Engineering courses taught in the summer?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
       <p>At the present time, we do not offer Systems Engineering courses  in the summer. &nbsp;However, several  Engineering Management courses are taught each summer and up to three of these  can be applied to the M.S. in Systems Engineering.<br>
   </p>
       </div>
 
  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>When are  Systems Engineering courses taught?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>What is the deadline for applying to the  program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
         <p>The application deadline is generally four weeks before the beginning of the semester for domestic students. However, it is advisable to apply much sooner than this to ensure that your application materials will be received in time for admission.&nbsp;Often, transcripts are delayed in transmission from your undergraduate university.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>International applicants must apply much sooner, generally six months before the beginning of the semester, to ensure that they will have enough time to receive a U.S. visa.&nbsp; </p>

  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>Can I take courses at other universities and apply them to the M.S. in Systems Engineering?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
      <p>Students can take <em><strong>up to two courses</strong></em> from other universities by following the inter-institutional enrollment process.</p>

    <div class="accordionbody">
      <p>ENEE 660 must be completed before ENEE 661. These two courses should be completed before ENEE 663. ENEE 662 can be taken after the student has passed the test in mathematics and MATLAB or completed ENEE 669 â€“ Math and MATLAB. All four courses should be completed before taking ENEE 670 - Systems Engineering Project. However, it is acceptable to take ENEE 663 concurrently with ENEE 670. The required electives can be taken in any order. </p>
