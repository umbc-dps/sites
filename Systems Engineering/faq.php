<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>What are the academic requirements for admission  to the Systems Engineering Certificate Program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
   <p>Applicants must have a B.S. degree, preferably in  engineering, computer science or information systems. Professional work  experience is desirable, but not required. The minimum GPA for regular acceptance  to UMBC graduate programs is 3.0.&nbsp;  However, applicants with a lower GPA may be admitted to the certificate  program with the provision that they must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher in  order to continue in the program and to receive a certificate. In addition, students must pass a test in  mathematics and MATLAB or pass a one-credit summer course entitled ENEE 669 -  Math and MATLAB, before enrolling in ENEE 662 - Modeling, Simulation and  Analysis.

    <h4>What  are the academic requirements for admission to the Systems Engineering Master&rsquo;s  Program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
   <p>Applicants must have a B.S.  degree, preferably in engineering, computer science or information systems.&nbsp;Professional work experience is desirable, but  not required. The minimum GPA for regular acceptance to UMBC graduate programs  is 3.0.&nbsp; However, applicants with a lower  GPA may be admitted provisionally.  Usually, full admission will be granted upon achieving a GPA of 3.0 or  higher in the first two graduate courses.&nbsp;In addition, students must pass a test in  mathematics and MATLAB or pass a one-credit summer course entitled ENEE 669 -  Math and MATLAB, before enrolling in ENEE 662 - Modeling, Simulation and  Analysis.

    <h4>Can  all five Systems Engineering certificate courses be applied to a Master&rsquo;s degree?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
   <p>All five of the Systems  Engineering certificate courses apply to the M.S. in Systems Engineering, M.S.  in Electrical Engineering, M.S. in Computer Science, and the M.S. in  Engineering Management degrees.<br>

    <h4>Are  any Systems Engineering courses taught in the summer?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
       <p>At the present time, we do not offer Systems Engineering courses  in the summer. &nbsp;However, several  Engineering Management courses are taught each summer and up to three of these  can be applied to the M.S. in Systems Engineering.<br>

    <h4>What standards  apply to the UMBC Systems Engineering program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
   <p>UMBC&rsquo;s SE Master&rsquo;s program fits the INCOSE* model for an  Optimum SE program.&nbsp; The UMBC SE required  and elective courses meet all of the requirements specified by INCOSE, as shown  below.</p>

    <h4>What is the deadline for applying to the  program?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
         <p>The application deadline is generally four weeks before the beginning of the semester for domestic students. However, it is advisable to apply much sooner than this to ensure that your application materials will be received in time for admission.&nbsp;Often, transcripts are delayed in transmission from your undergraduate university.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>International applicants must apply much sooner, generally six months before the beginning of the semester, to ensure that they will have enough time to receive a U.S. visa.&nbsp; </p>

  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>Can I take courses at other universities and apply them to the M.S. in Systems Engineering?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
      <p>Students can take <em><strong>up to two courses</strong></em> from other universities by following the inter-institutional enrollment process.</p>
   <p>Inter-institutional enrollment is a program that allows qualifying students at University System of Maryland (USM) institutions to take selected courses at other USM campuses while only paying tuition at their home school. Through the program, students register for courses at both their home and host institutions, but are billed only by their home school. At the end of the semester, the student's credits and grades from the host institution are transferred to their home institution. This differs from standard transfer coursework in that both credits and grades transfer. The deadline for registering for courses at another institution is two weeks before the start of the semester. </p>

  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>Is it necessary to take the five Systems Engineering courses for in sequence?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
      <p>ENEE 660 must be completed before ENEE 661. These two courses should be completed before ENEE 663. ENEE 662 can be taken after the student has passed the test in mathematics and MATLAB or completed ENEE 669 â€“ Math and MATLAB. All four courses should be completed before taking ENEE 670 - Systems Engineering Project. However, it is acceptable to take ENEE 663 concurrently with ENEE 670. The required electives can be taken in any order. </p>

  <div class="accordionheader">
    <h4>What courses are required for the M.S. in Systems Engineering beyond the six core courses?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4></div>

    <div class="accordionbody">
      <p>The Systems Engineering M.S. program requires four breadth and depth electives in systems engineering and related disciplines, such as electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science and mechanical engineering.  </p>
