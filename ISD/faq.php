          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>The ISD- Training Systems Program offers a variety of flexible   options in course topics. Students have the opportunity to   choose five elective courses in their program. Coursework can be chosen from   areas such as performance improvement, online learning, instructional   technology, project management, managing training and performance programs and   more. Coursework usually includes hands-on projects that help students reach   their professional goals. Our program&rsquo;s &ldquo;applied learning&rdquo; philosophy allows   students to work on class projects that often directly relate to assignments   within their careers.</p>

</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>UMBC&rsquo;s online courses are administered through a campus management system called Blackboard. It is accessed through the student e-mail account you receive when you first become a student at UMBC. The course is structured around a detailed syllabus that provides students with an assignment schedule and other information they will need to complete the course. Most communication within the course takes place on the Discussion Board, an area on your course website where you participate in class discussions and submit assignments. Tutorials for posting to the Discussion board are available on Blackboard that can be found <a href="https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/faq/Blackboard" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h4><a href="" id=""></a>What is the difference between an asynchronous and synchronous online course?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>An asynchronous online course is an eLearning class that does not require students and instructors to be online at the same time. A synchronous online course is an eLearning class that requires students and instructors to be online at the same time. Students can log-in from a PC at any location, as long as it has an internet connection. Please consult the schedule of classes for which method of online delivery and times. </p>

            <h4><a href="" id=""></a>I&rsquo;m not sure online education is for me.  Can I complete the Master&rsquo;s program on-campus?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>No. There are, however, a few courses that can be taken  on-campus. (See Course Descriptions) <br>
 </p>
</div>


<div class="accordionheader">
            <h4><a href="" id=""></a>Is the Master&rsquo;s Degree completed online accredited? <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>Yes, UMBC is accredited by the Middle States Association. A Master&rsquo;s Degree completed online has the same level of accreditation as our traditional on-campus degree.<br>
 </p>
</div>


<div class="accordionheader">
            <h4><a href="" id=""></a>Do I ever have to come to campus? <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>Most of our online courses do not require that you come to campus. Some instructors may choose to have an on-campus orientation at the beginning of the course so that students can meet or they may schedule occasional meetings during the semester, depending on student interest.</p>
</div>


<div class="accordionheader">
            <h4><a href="" id=""></a>How many hours do online courses require each week? <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>Online courses generally require 8-12 hours per week including readings, Internet research, weekly discussions, sending/receiving e-mail, and completing assignments.<br>
 </p>
</div>


<div class="accordionheader">
            <h4><a href="" id=""></a>Are online courses self-paced?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>Our courses are instructor-led, with term start and end dates and due dates for assignments. That being said, most course material is available from the beginning of the semester, and students are free to read ahead or prepare for future assignments as they choose.</p>

<div class="accordionheader">
            <h4><a href="" id=""></a>Do online courses cost more? <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>Tuition is the same whether you are an online student or an on-campus student. However, online classes do not required a student to pay certain fees (e.g. parking) that apply only to campus activities.</p>
        </div>


<div class="accordionheader">
          <h4><a href="" id=""></a>How do I proceed through a UMBC online course?<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
</div>


          <div class="accordionbody">
            <p>Once you are accepted to the program, you will receive a UMBC e-mail account. Near the beginning of the semester, most instructors send their students a &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; e-mail message, notifying them that the course has been activated on Blackboard.  You can then go to Blackboard, select your course and read the syllabus thoroughly. From that point, you log on regularly (several times a week) to check announcements from the instructor, post to the Discussion Board, respond to feedback from your classmates and the instructor, and submit assignments.<br>
 </p>
 <p>You can communicate with your instructor through the discussion board, e-mail or by phone. Some instructors also have online office hours.</p>
 <p>Also, most assignments are turned in by posting them to the &ldquo;Discussion Board&rdquo; or by emailing them to the instructor. In many classes, assignments are always due the same day and time every week (example: Wednesday by 11:59 p.m.).</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="accordionheader">
   <h4><a href="" id="a2"></a>Are Online Classes Easier than Face-to-Face? <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h4>
 </div>
 <div class="accordionbody1">
   <p>No. Online classes take as much or more time as a class you might   take on campus. Online courses are never out of session. Students are   expected to log on and contribute to discussion several times a week.   That also means reading messages every week from the instructor and   other students.</p>
   <p>There are no conclusive studies comparing the two methods, but   initial studies indicate that online students perform as well or better   than their in-class counterparts. </p>
   <p>Early single-institution studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that   online learning at least holds its own with the face-to-face classroom.   For some, in fact, online learning may result in better comprehension. </p>
   <p>For any course (including in-person), learning ultimately depends on   the quality of the instructor, course material and participation of the   students. The method, too, is important. Courses that encourage online   discussion and interaction between students, their peers and the   instructor typically demonstrate higher levels of participation than   traditional courses.</p>

<div class="accordionbody"><a href="" id=""></a>The Final Project Seminar course (EDUC 794) is a capstone   course where students complete a comprehensive project that ties together things   that they have learned throughout the program.

This is done by completing a   project that will be delivered to the client at the end of the course. The   project or assignment(s) for the internship do not have to be as comprehensive   in scope as the Final Project Seminar course.
