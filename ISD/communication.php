Advising should be completed       through email. Please allow Dr. Hodell 7 - 10 days to review and approve       your course selections. Be sure to send your finalized form only.       Requesting changes after submitting your advising form will move your       request to the end of the list. (See link above for advising form and       instructions).<strong></strong></li>

      <li><strong>Registration:</strong> After students are authorized,       they may register online via myUMBC according to the dates below.       Authorization does not guarantee a seat in a course. You must register       online and are advised to do so as soon as possible. Instructions for how       to register online may be found here: <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/">http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/</a><strong> </strong></li>

    <p><strong>Wait List:</strong> ISD  courses automatically have the Student Administration (SA) System hold any wait  lists. The ISD department cannot prioritize the wait list, nor can we override  the wait list.

    <p><strong>Authorization Information and Notes:</strong> <br>
      The ISD Department will give authorizations to  student who request them and are approved. This will result in some courses  having more authorizations issued than available seats in a course. We will  also continue to give authorization to courses that are full. <br>
      Authorization does not guarantee a student a  seat in the course. Students must register online through their myUMBC account  to have a space in the course. If you opt to put yourself on the waitlist for a  course that is full be sure to read about wait lists in the link above. </p>
    <p><u>Put your legal name and campus ID in the body of  the email with your authorization request.</u> It  is harder to enter an authorization for the correct individual if we cannot  look you up. </p>
    <p>Make sure Renee Eisenhuth, (<a href="mailto:reisen@umbc.edu">reisen@umbc.edu</a>) was copied on your authorization email from Dr. Hodell. If she  does not receive the email she will not enter the authorization. Only forward  your authorization email to Renee if she was not included. </p>
    <p>Students interested in EDUC 792T and EDUC 794  should contact Dr. Williams directly at <a href="mailto:gregw@umbc.edu">gregw@umbc.edu</a> prior to requesting  authorization to discuss their internship or final project. You must include in  your email to Dr. Hodell that you have spoken to Dr. Williams before Dr. Hodell  will approve. </p>
