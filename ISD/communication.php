    <p>·        Selection: Authorization is section and semester specific. Make sure you are selecting the correct semester and section for your authorization. </p>
    <p>·        Plan of Study: You are not in the required plan of study. Some courses are reserved for students in that certificate or Master&rsquo;s plan of study only (until closer to the semester start date.) If you do not have that plan on your student record, you may be blocked from online registration. </p>
    <p>·        Authorization: Your authorization has not been entered to date. Please give enough time, after Dr. Hodell&rsquo;s approval for everything to be entered. </p>
    <p>·        Advising: You did not complete the advising process. An advising form must be sent every semester for course approval.</p>

    <p><strong>Spring 2017 Registration Instructions:</strong> <br>
      (Registration is a  three step process) </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li><strong>Advising:</strong> All students must contact Dr. Hodell, <a href="mailto:hodell@umbc.edu">hodell@umbc.edu</a>, to receive academic advising, every       semester. Advising should be completed through email. Please allow Dr.       Hodell 7 - 10 days to review and approve your course selections. Be sure       to send your finalized form only. Requesting changes after submitting your       advising form will move your request to the end of the list. (See link       above for advising form and instructions).<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> After Dr. Hodell approves your course       selection your authorization will be entered into the registration system.       You will be able to register after the dates shown below. More       authorizations than total number of spaces in a course may be entered.<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Online       Registration:</strong> After students are authorized, they may register online via myUMBC       according to the dates below. Authorization does not guarantee a seat in a       course. You must register online and are advised to do so as soon as       possible. Instructions for how to register online may be found here: <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/">http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/</a><strong> </strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Registration  Schedule:</strong> <br>
      <strong>October 31, 2016: </strong>Advance registration begins for current Graduate  Students<br>
      <strong>December 1, 2016: </strong>New Graduate Student Registration Begins <br>
      <strong>January 23, 2017:</strong> Non-Degree Student Registration Begins </p>
    <p><strong>Wait List:</strong> ISD courses automatically have the  Student Administration (SA) System hold any wait lists. The ISD department  cannot prioritize the wait list, nor can we override the wait list. Read the  &ldquo;Student Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; about waitlists prior to placing yourself  on one, <a href="https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists">https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Authorization  Information and Notes:</strong> <br>
      The ISD Department  will give authorizations to student who request them and are approved. This  will result in some courses having more authorizations issued than available  seats in a course. We will also continue to give authorization to courses that  are full. <br>
      Authorization does  not guarantee a student a seat in the course. Students must register online  through their myUMBC account to have a space in the course. If you opt to put  yourself on the waitlist for a course that is full be sure to read about wait  lists in the link above. </p>
    <p><u>Put your campus ID on  your authorization request.</u> <br>
      Students interested  in EDUC 792T and EDUC 794 should contact Dr. Williams directly at <a href="mailto:gregw@umbc.edu">gregw@umbc.edu</a> prior to requesting authorization to discuss their internship or  final project. You must include in your email to Dr. Hodell that you have  spoken to Dr. Williams before Dr. Hodell will approve. </p>
