      (Registration is a  three step process) </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li><strong>Advising:</strong> All students must contact Dr. Hodell, <a href="mailto:hodell@umbc.edu">hodell@umbc.edu</a>, to receive academic advising, every       semester. Advising should be completed through email. Please allow Dr.       Hodell 7 - 10 days to review and approve your course selections. Be sure       to send your finalized form only. Requesting changes after submitting your       advising form will move your request to the end of the list. (See link       above for advising form and instructions).<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> After Dr. Hodell approves your course       selection your authorization will be entered into the registration system.       You will be able to register after the dates shown below. More       authorizations than total number of spaces in a course may be entered.<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Online       Registration:</strong> After students are authorized, they may register online via myUMBC       according to the dates below. Authorization does not guarantee a seat in a       course. You must register online and are advised to do so as soon as       possible. Instructions for how to register online may be found here: <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/">http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/</a><strong> </strong></li>

    <p><strong>Registration  Schedule:</strong> <br>
      <strong>April 4, 2016: </strong>Registration begins for current  Graduate Students (The ISD program will not begin to enter authorizations until  April 11, 2016)<br>
      <strong>June 1, 2016: </strong>New Graduate Student Registration Begins <br>
      <strong>August 24, 2016:</strong> Non-Degree Student Registration Begins </p>
    <p><strong>Wait List:</strong> ISD courses automatically have the  Student Administration (SA) System hold any wait lists. The ISD department  cannot prioritize the wait list, nor can we override the wait list. Read the  &ldquo;Student Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; about waitlists prior to placing yourself  on one, <a href="https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists">https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Authorization  Information and Notes:</strong> <br>
      The ISD Department  will give authorizations to student who request them and are approved. This  will result in some courses having more authorizations issued than available  seats in a course. We will also continue to give authorization to courses that  are full. <br>
      Authorization does  not guarantee a student a seat in the course. Students must register online  through their myUMBC account to have a space in the course. If you opt to put  yourself on the waitlist for a course that is full be sure to read about wait  lists in the link above. </p>
    <p><u>Put your legal name  and campus ID in the body of the email with your authorization request.</u> It is harder to enter an authorization  for the correct individual if we cannot look you up. </p>
Students interested in EDUC 792T and EDUC 794 should contact Dr.  Williams directly at <a href="mailto:gregw@umbc.edu">gregw@umbc.edu</a> prior to requesting  authorization to discuss their internship or final project. You must include in  your email to Dr. Hodell that you have spoken to Dr. Williams before Dr. Hodell  will approve.</div>
