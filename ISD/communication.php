    <p><strong>Fall 2016 Registration Instructions:</strong> <br>
      (Registration is a  three step process) </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li><strong>Advising:</strong> All students must contact Dr. Hodell, <a href="mailto:hodell@umbc.edu">hodell@umbc.edu</a>, to receive academic advising, every       semester. Advising should be completed through email. Please allow Dr.       Hodell 7 - 10 days to review and approve your course selections. Be sure       to send your finalized form only. Requesting changes after submitting your       advising form will move your request to the end of the list. (See link       above for advising form and instructions).<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> After Dr. Hodell approves your course       selection your authorization will be entered into the registration system.       You will be able to register after the dates shown below. More       authorizations than total number of spaces in a course may be entered.<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Online       Registration:</strong> After students are authorized, they may register online via myUMBC       according to the dates below. Authorization does not guarantee a seat in a       course. You must register online and are advised to do so as soon as       possible. Instructions for how to register online may be found here: <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/">http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/</a><strong> </strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Registration  Schedule:</strong> <br>
      <strong>April 4, 2016: </strong>Registration begins for current  Graduate Students (The ISD program will not begin to enter authorizations until  April 11, 2016)<br>
      <strong>June 6, 2016: </strong>New Graduate Student Registration Begins <br>
      <strong>August 24, 2016:</strong> Non-Degree Student Registration Begins </p>
    <p><strong>Wait List:</strong> ISD courses automatically have the  Student Administration (SA) System hold any wait lists. The ISD department  cannot prioritize the wait list, nor can we override the wait list. Read the  &ldquo;Student Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; about waitlists prior to placing yourself  on one, <a href="https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists">https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Authorization  Information and Notes:</strong> <br>
      The ISD Department  will give authorizations to student who request them and are approved. This  will result in some courses having more authorizations issued than available  seats in a course. We will also continue to give authorization to courses that  are full. <br>
      Authorization does  not guarantee a student a seat in the course. Students must register online  through their myUMBC account to have a space in the course. If you opt to put  yourself on the waitlist for a course that is full be sure to read about wait  lists in the link above. </p>
    <p><u>Put your legal name  and campus ID in the body of the email with your authorization request.</u> It is harder to enter an authorization  for the correct individual if we cannot look you up. </p>
Students interested in EDUC 792T and EDUC 794 should contact Dr.  Williams directly at <a href="mailto:gregw@umbc.edu">gregw@umbc.edu</a> prior to requesting  authorization to discuss their internship or final project. You must include in  your email to Dr. Hodell that you have spoken to Dr. Williams before Dr. Hodell  will approve.</div>

    <p><strong>Reasons You May Not Be Able to Register for Summer Courses:</strong></p>
    <p>1. Holds – You have a hold on your account, <a href="https://wiki.umbc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=31198450" target="_blank">https://wiki.umbc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=31198450</a></p>

    <p>3. Plan of Study – You are not in the required plan of study. Some courses are reserved for students in that certificate or Master&rsquo;s degree only. If you never applied for the Master&rsquo;s degree or the certificate plan of study that requires that course, you may be blocked from that class.</p>
    <p>4. Authorization – Your authorization has not been entered to date. Please give enough time for everything to be entered.</p>
    <p>5. Advising – You did not complete the advising process. An advising form must be sent every semester for course approval. Read your ISD Current Student emails for the summer 2016 registration instructions, <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/isd/communication" target="_blank">http://www.umbc.edu/isd/communication</a>. You should allow 7 – 10 days for your advising form to be reviewed and processed during busy times.</p>
    <p><strong>Reminders:</strong></p>
    <p>·        E-Billing is completed online through the Student Business Services (SBS) office. You may view the billing schedule, tuition, late fee, payment, and other helpful information on their website. <a href="http://sbs.umbc.edu/" target="_blank">http://sbs.umbc.edu/</a></p>
    <p>·        Authorization does not reserve a space in a course. You are advised to register online through your myUMBC account as soon as possible. If you wait and the course is full you may have to place yourself on the wait list.</p>
    <p>·        If you do not know how to register online you may view helpful videos on the Registrar&rsquo;s website here, <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/" target="_blank">http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/</a>.</p>

Advising should be completed       through email. Please allow Dr. Hodell 7 - 10 days to review and approve       your course selections. Be sure to send your finalized form only.       Requesting changes after submitting your advising form will move your       request to the end of the list. (See link above for advising form and       instructions).<strong></strong></li>

(We       will send an email when your authorization is entered.)<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Registration:</strong> After students are authorized,       they may register online via myUMBC according to the dates below.       Authorization does not guarantee a seat in a course. You must register       online and are advised to do so as soon as possible. Instructions for how       to register online may be found here: <a href="http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/">http://registrar.umbc.edu/services/registration/Information-About-Registration/</a><strong> </strong></li>

      <strong>January 18, 2016:</strong> Non-Degree Student Registration Begins </p>
    <p><strong>Wait List:</strong> ISD  courses automatically have the Student Administration (SA) System hold any wait  lists. The ISD department cannot prioritize the wait list, nor can we override  the wait list. Read the &ldquo;Student Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; about waitlists  prior to placing yourself on one, <a href="https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists">https://wiki.umbc.edu/display/sa/Student+FAQ-+Waitlists</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Authorization Information and Notes:</strong> <br>
      The ISD Department will give authorizations to  student who request them and are approved. This will result in some courses  having more authorizations issued than available seats in a course. We will  also continue to give authorization to courses that are full. <br>
      Authorization does not guarantee a student a  seat in the course. Students must register online through their myUMBC account  to have a space in the course. If you opt to put yourself on the waitlist for a  course that is full be sure to read about wait lists in the link above. </p>
    <p><u>Put your legal name and campus ID in the body of  the email with your authorization request.</u> It  is harder to enter an authorization for the correct individual if we cannot  look you up. </p>
    <p>Make sure Renee Eisenhuth, (<a href="mailto:reisen@umbc.edu">reisen@umbc.edu</a>) was copied on your authorization email from Dr. Hodell. If she  does not receive the email she will not enter the authorization. Only forward  your authorization email to Renee if she was not included. </p>
    <p>Students interested in EDUC 792T and EDUC 794  should contact Dr. Williams directly at <a href="mailto:gregw@umbc.edu">gregw@umbc.edu</a> prior to requesting  authorization to discuss their internship or final project.
