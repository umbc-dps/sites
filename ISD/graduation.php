   <h4><a id="exam"></a>Comprehensive Exam (Required for Master's students admitted prior to fall 2012)</h4>
   </strong>The purpose of the comprehensive examination in the master&rsquo;s program is to show a mastery of knowledge within the field of training and development. You will be asked to problem solve, analyze and evaluate a case in a training and development context, and synthesize for the reader your understanding through recommendations about the case. Part of the task is to select an appropriate (theoretical or research based) framework from which to write an analysis and evaluation of the case. An additional focus needs to be on support for your judgments and what you say in response to the case by citing the research or theoretical models found in the literature in the training and development field. The response needs to go beyond the foundations you have learned in your course work to demonstrate your knowledge of a broader, more comprehensive scope of reading and subsequent reflection by you in this field.<br>
   <br>
   This is a take-home, open book exam that must be completed over a weekend period (9 a.m. Friday - 6p.m. Monday). Your response to the question(s) is limited to ten (10) double-spaced typed (printed) pages, including your bibliography. APA style is required. <br>
   <br>
   <h4>Exam Dates</h4>
Normally, the fall exam occurs on a weekend either late October/ early November; the spring exam occurs on a weekend either March/ early April; and the summer exam occurs on a weekend in late June. <br>
   </p>
   <p>Current dates for upcoming exams are:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>Spring 2016:</strong> March 4 - 7, 2016</li>
     <li><strong>Summer 2016:</strong> June 17 - 20, 2016</li>

   <h4>Portfolio Requirement - Required for Master's students admitted fall 2012 and on</h4>
   <p>Students admitted to the Master&rsquo;s degree in Instructional Systems Development – Training Systems, beginning with the Fall 2012 semester, will be required to complete a professional portfolio. This requirement replaces the current comprehensive exam requirement.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide students an opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned in their coursework and the program. It also provides students, employers, clients, colleagues, etc. with tangible evidence of our graduates&rsquo; knowledge, skill, abilities and competencies. Portfolios can be a wonderful career tool that may assist graduates in getting jobs, promotions, new clients, and other professional opportunities.</p>
