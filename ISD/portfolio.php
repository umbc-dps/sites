 <h3>UMBC ISD Portfolio Requirements</h3>
 <p>Beginning with the Fall 2012 semester, students admitted to the Master&rsquo;s degree in Instructional Systems Development – Training Systems, will be required to complete a professional portfolio. This requirement replaces the <a href="graduation#exam">comprehensive exam requirement</a>.</p>
 <p> The purpose of this requirement is to provide students an opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned in their coursework and the program. It also provides students, employers, clients, colleagues, etc. with tangible evidence of our graduates&rsquo; knowledge, skill, abilities and competencies. Portfolios can be a wonderful career tool that may assist graduates in getting jobs, promotions, new clients, and other professional opportunities.</p>
 <p> Students have the opportunity in nearly every class to create basic artifacts. With some polishing and improvements, these artifacts may be used to satisfy the portfolio requirement.</p>
 <p>In order to graduate each ISD Master’s student must provide a professional portfolio of course-related work samples that reflects their accomplishments throughout their tenure in the program. Portfolios must be approved by the portfolio committee for the student to graduate.</p>
 <p>The portfolio will contain a <strong><u>minimum of 8</u></strong> and <strong><u>maximum of 10</u></strong> work samples.</p>

 <ul>
   <li>Two  work samples must be from the 4 core courses (EDUC 602, 603, 605, and 671)</li>
   <li>At  least one sample must be included from either EDUC 771, 792 or 794</li>
   <li>Additional  samples may include work from other ISD program elective courses</li>
   <li>Students  may only use work samples that were created as course requirements for the ISD  program.   Samples created before they  entered the program or samples that are not related to ISD program requirements  will <u>not</u> be allowed.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>Up to two co-created or group work samples will be accepted with proper documentation, and consent from other contributors and a description of individual contribution to the work product. </p>
 
 <h4>Portfolio Content</h4>
 <p>In addition to the work samples, students will be required to include the following items, which may be documents, video, audio or other formats selected by the student:</p>
 <ul type="disc">
   <li>Overarching  piece reflecting the rationale for the selected work samples and portfolio  structure (250 words max)</li>
   <li>Student&rsquo;s  career goals and highlights of their learning in the program (250 words max)</li>
   <li>Resume(2  page max)</li>
   <li>Cover  sheet explaining each work sample, indicating competencies demonstrated and  significant learning points.  Please  format your work sample using the CCAR &nbsp; (Competency, Context, Action and  Result) method. &nbsp;This video shows you how to do that at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJEgScNghNI#t=27m36s" target="_blank" title="Formatting Your Portfolio">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJEgScNghNI#t=27m36s</a></li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Cover Page Format for Each Work Sample</h4>
 <p>Each work sample must have a cover page to introduce the reader to the sample.  It must have the following format:</p>

<table id="costs">
  <tr>
 <td>Competency:</td>
 <td>Identify the competency the sample demonstrates</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
 <td>Context:</td>
 <td>Describe situation where you created the sample</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
 <td>Action: </td>
 <td>Describe what you did &amp; why</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
 <td>Results: </td>
 <td>Describe outcomes, use measurable results if possible</td>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
</table>

<h4>Examples of Work Samples</h4>    
<p>Students  should aim to present a varied portfolio that demonstrates a solid grasp of  core competencies and the competencies in their area(s) of interest or  specialty. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary to demonstrate all of the  competencies in any model.  Examples of the  types of work samples that may be included in the student&rsquo;s portfolio are: </p>
<ul type="disc">
       
      <li>Case  studies </li>
         <li>Design  plans or documents</li>

<h4>Portfolio Structure</h4>
  All portfolios  will be submitted via a file sharing site <strong><u>or</u></strong> a website of the student&rsquo;s creation. &nbsp;<strong><u>Either  is acceptable</u></strong>.  Students are  responsible for the creation and maintenance of their portfolio and may use a  web building tool of their own choice.  </p>
<h5>File sharing tools to consider:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Box  - <a href="http://www.box.com">www.box.com</a></li>
  <li>Dropbox  - <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">www.dropbox.com</a></li>
  <li>Evernote  – <a href="http://www.evernote.com">www.evernote.com</a></li>
  <li>Google  Docs – <a href="http://www.docs.google.com">www.docs.google.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Website tools (optional) to consider:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;Google  Sites -<a href="http://sites.google.com"> http://sites.google.com/</a></li>
  <li>&nbsp;Weebly  -<a href="http://www.weebly.com"> http://www.weebly.com/</a></li>
  <li>&nbsp;Webs  -<a href="http://members.freewebs.com"> http://members.freewebs.com/</a></li>
  <li> Wix <a href="http://www.wix.com">http://www.wix.com/</a></li>
  <li> Visual VC - <a href="http://www.visualcv.com">http://www.visualcv.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is  recommended that students do not spend a lot of time designing and creating a  website since simple file sharing is acceptable.</p>
  <p>The design of  each portfolio will be unique to the student. The portfolio should be well  organized and carefully planned so that all visual, audio, and text are clear  and flow intuitively for the viewer. &nbsp;All files and links must operate  flawlessly.</p>
  <h4>Preparation  for the Portfolio</h4>
  <p>The program  offers the following resources in order to prepare for the portfolio:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full-credit  online course (EDUC &nbsp;689  Portfolio Development in Fall &amp; Summer)</li>
  <li>Optional  online portfolio tutorials</li>
  <li>Sample  portfolios from alumni and advanced students</li>
  <li>Interim  check-ins during the routine advising process</li>
  <li><a href="documents/portfoliochecklist.pdf">Portfolio Checklist</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Initial Review of the Portfolio</h4>
  <p>Students  will submit their portfolios for <strong><u>initial</u></strong> review after their 6th course and no later than their 8th course.  The purpose of this review is to provide  students with feedback so they can be prepared when they submit their portfolio  for the <u>final</u> review.</p>
  <p>When you are ready to share your portfolio please contact Dr. Williams at <a href="mailto:gregw@umbc.edu">gregw@umbc.edu</a>.</p>
<h4>Final Review of the Portfolio</h4>
<p>Each portfolio must  be submitted for <strong><u>final</u></strong> review  in mid- semester during the semester when students expect to graduate (April  1st for Spring, July 1st for Summer, November 1st for Fall graduation). &nbsp;A  feedback committee consisting of faculty, ISD board members, selected alumni  and employers will conduct a preliminary review of each portfolio and offer  suggestions as necessary.  Final grading (pass  or not pass) of the portfolios will be made by vote of the committee.  Feedback will be made in a timely fashion, so  students can meet graduation timeline requirements.  The committee, at its option, may allow for  additional work to be completed to meet requirements.  Possible outcomes may include:<br>
  1. Pass – pass  without any conditions<br>
  2. Pass With  Conditions – passing is conditional on making minor changes<br>
  3. Not Pass –  student must make changes changes/revision based on committee feedback and then  must resubmit their portfolio</p>
<h4>Final Portfolio Submission Deadlines:</h4>
 
<p>The semester that you apply for graduation is when your portfolio is due.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fall Semester: November 1st</li>
  <li>Spring Semester: April 1st</li>
  <li>Summer session: July 1st</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are ready to share your portfolio please contact Dr. Williams at <a href="mailto:gregw@umbc.edu">gregw@umbc.edu</a>.</p>
<h4>Timetable </h4>
  <p>The  following time table is provided as a planning tool to guide students</p>
<p><strong>First Semester</strong> – select file sharing  tool, post from courses after each semester<br>

  <strong>After 6 courses</strong> – student must post  portfolio for initial cursory review by evaluation committee<br>
  <strong>Final Semester</strong> – submit final  portfolio mid-semester of semester that student intends to graduate (April 1st for Spring, July 1st for  Summer, November 1st for Fall graduation). <br>
  <strong>After Every Semester</strong> – post work samples  from course(s) taken that semester<br>
  <strong>Ongoing</strong> – student request  feedback from fellow students, co-workers, alumni &amp; professionals</p>
<h4>Portfolio Ownership</h4>
<p>All submitted  portfolios are the property of the student but may be used as examples by UMBC  unless otherwise specified by the student.</p>
